			<dc:title>Structure and possible function of vocalizations of captive red-legged seriemas (Cariama cristata)</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Padget, Ami Elizabeth</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Very little is known about red-legged seriema (Cariama cristata) vocalizations and behavior.  The focus of my research was to analyze the structure of red-legged seriema primary calls and to begin to test hypotheses related to their function.  Captive red-legged seriema behavior, both vocal and non-vocal, was recorded at 7 institutions located in the United States from May 2007 through November 2008.  To test whether calls serve a predator alarm function, seriemas were presented with a large stuffed dog, representing a predator stimulus, and 2 control stimuli, a large, stuffed penguin and a large, flowering potted plant.  Baseline recordings with no manipulations were also made throughout the day, during the course of the study.  All recordings of seriema vocalizations were assessed using sound analysis software to generate sound spectrograms for comparison.  I identified three different note types within the seriema primary call: upsweep notes (U), ladder notes (L), and two-part notes (T).  Each call begins with a set of U notes that increase in rate and lead into the main part of the call, which is made of L and T notes.  Each note type was assessed for duration, frequency, energy, and entropy measurements.  These measurements were reduced using factor analysis into two relevant factors.  There were substantial differences across individuals for note type acoustic structure.  Group differences in note types, including sex, location, and age, were not found.  When presented with the dog model, vocal responses were given by only 3 individuals.  Overall, it may be possible to identify individual seriemas by analyzing the structure of their primary call, which may allow researchers to identify individuals without physical markers.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Youth Can! Grow Healthy!</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Carberry, Andrew Nils</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study presents a formative evaluation of an afterschool program that combined youth development and school garden curricula.  This program used a novel approach to teach elementary school children about fruits and vegetables and to engage them in advocacy for the physical activity and nutrition environments in their community.  The youth development curriculum included sessions on team building, community pride, healthy eating and physical activity, and advocacy.  Photovoice was used as a method to allow participants to assess their community and communicate findings with leaders.  Participants selected community leaders to invite to their school and shared their findings via a presentation of the photographs and a plan for action.  The school garden curriculum included lessons on plant parts, plant nutrients, site evaluation, and pollination.  Participants planted and harvested vegetables in a raised bed constructed at their school.  Formative evaluation was conducted through the use of an evaluation form to collect information about each session.  Evaluations were examined to provide recommendations to strengthen future program design and implementation.  Themes of the evaluation were: successful methods for engaging youth, issues within the social environment, and implications for program management.  Successful methods for engaging youth included creative activities, working in pairs, and experiential activities.  Issues in the social environment were behavioral problems, shyness, gender groups, and competition.  Areas of concern for program management included recruitment, attendance, volunteer training, team building activities, and survey administration.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Autonomy and Independence of International Institutions: ICSID</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Park, In Jae</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Can international institutions work independently from the great powers in terms of autonomy and independence? To answer the question, this thesis analyzes 197 concluded arbitration cases and the Convention of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). But why the ICSID? Trade liberalization has long been sought by almost all the countries under multilateralism represented by the GATT and its successor, the WTO. However, due mainly to slow and laborious decision making, proceedings for dispute settlement and acquiring mandatory consent from all the member countries under the WTO, states -especially great economic powers - began to turn to Free Trade Agreements(FTAs) toavoid such problems. Most of the FTAs include Bilateral Investment Treaties and investment dispute settlement provisions. When investment disputes arise, the parties can resolve them bilaterally or they may bring their cases to an international dispute settlement institution. The ICSID is one of leading dispute settlement institutions in the field of international investments. Since the late 1990s, the cases argued at and the references to the ICSID began to increase sharply indicating that states have begun to perceive the ICSID as more important. So I analyzed the ICSID in terms of its autonomy and independence. The findings are as follows.Throughout the Articles of the ICSID Convention, the ICSID endeavors to keep its autonomy and independence. Although there are more arbitrators from developing countries than developed countries in the arbitration panel, developed country arbitrators have been selected more frequently as members of arbitration Tribunals of the ICSID. But the compositions of the Tribunals do not affect the winning rate especially fordeveloped country in the arbitrations. Although the durations of the arbitration proceedings vary in each party category, developing countries tend to show their lack of legal capacities and monetary shortage, especially needed for the due process procedures in arbitrations. As for compliance to ICSID awards, almost all the Contracting Statesfollowed the awards except for some cases, especially Argentine ones. In general, the ICSID has maintained its autonomy and independence though there also is some evidence and some cases where this argument is not supported. Asmore pending cases turn to concluded ones, there will be more cases available for furtherresearch on the ICSID.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An Evaluation of Field Management Practices to Improve Bobwhite Habitat</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Gruchy, John P.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Conversion of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) to managed native warm-season grasses (nwsg) and associated forbs benefits many wildlife species that depend on early successional habitat. Planting nwsg, however, may not be necessary depending on the composition of the seedbank. Treatments were implemented in a randomized complete block design with replication during 2003 and 2004 at three study sites across Tennessee to determine the effects of seasonal herbicide applications and disking on tall fescue eradication and resulting vegetation composition and structure. Treatments included: fall glyphosate (2.2 kg ai/ha; Gly-4 2qt/ac); fall glyphosate followed by winter disking; fall imazapic (0.2 kg ai/ha; Plateau 12 oz/ac); fall imazapic followed by winter disking; spring glyphosate; spring glyphosate followed by fall disking; spring imazapic; and spring imazapic followed by fall disking. Vegetation composition and structure were measured June – September, and November 2004 and February, April, and June – September 2005. All treatments reduced tall fescue cover compared to control one growing season after treatment. Fall herbicide applications with and without disking decreased tall fescue cover more than spring treatments when measured two growing seasons after treatment. Reduction in tall fescue improved openness at ground level during the brooding season and angle of obstruction during the wintering period for bobwhites. Disking following herbicide application increased cover of bobwhite food plants, including common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisifolia), beggar’s-lice (Desmodium spp.), and beggar-ticks (Bidens spp.). Imazapic increased cover of desirable nwsg, such as broomsedge bluestem (Andropogon virginicus); however on 2 sites, imazapic applications resulted in increased cover of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata), which was structurally identical to tall fescue. Fall glyphosate applications are recommended to eradicate tall fescue. If certain undesirable plants are suspected to germinate from the seedbank after tall fescue is removed, an imazapic application may be necessary in April or May to control species such as johnsongrass (Sorghum halapense), crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis), and yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus).</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Molecular analysis of guano from bats in bat houses on organic pecan orchards</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Brown, Veronica Angelelli</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Bats are generalist predators of night flying insects, including many crop pests.  Pecan nut casebearer (Acrobasis nuxvorella), hickory shuckworm (Cydia caryana), and several stink bug species are some of the most damaging crop pests in pecan orchards. Attracting bats to agricultural areas using bats houses may reduce the numbers of these pests and, consequently, their economic impact.  This study uses quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) of mitochondrial DNA found in the guano of bats living in bat houses on organic pecan orchards to document the consumption of pecan nut casebearer, hickory shuckworm, and corn earworm (Helicoverpa zea), which is one of the most destructive pests of many crops throughout the world.  This study also uses direct sequencing of insect remains in bat fecal pellets to identify species of stink bugs consumed by bats in bat houses.  Evidence that bats prey upon crop pests supports the hypothesis that bats are both economically and ecologically beneficial to pecan farmers and provides incentives for bat conservation.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Expanding the Theory of Traumatic Bonding as it Relates to Forgiveness, Romantic Attachment, and Intention to Return</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Christman, Jennifer Anne</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Various empirically validated theories have explained the phenomenon of women in abusive relationships engaging in a repeated leave/return cycle when trying to terminate the relationship. The current study was designed to add to the already existing theories that focus on factors constraining women to stay in abusive relationships by evaluating the relationship between traumatic bond, forgiveness, and intention to return to the abusive relationship, and by evaluating the relationship between traumatic bond, attachment to abusive partner, and intention to return. The current sample consisted of 121 women residing in both urban and rural emergency domestic violence shelters. Forgiveness was found to partially mediate the relationship between traumatic bond and intention to return, and traumatic bond mediated the relationship between preoccupied attachment to the abusive partner and intention to return to the abusive relationship. These findings suggest that in this specific population it is important to not only address constraint variables (e.g., income, employment, child care, etc.), but to also address variables regarding the individual‟s emotional attachment to the relationship. Addressing these variables could be important new and additional points of intervention for women living in emergency domestic violence shelters.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Laser Processing of Refractory Metal - Refractory Carbide Alloys</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Rajput, Deepak</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The objective of the present study was to laser process a refractory metal – refractory carbide alloy based on W-Ti-C ternary system for severe service applications. The key concept was to cast a eutectic alloy of tungsten and titanium carbide/carbonitride straight from the melt through laser materials processing route. In the present study, a WTi- C ternary alloy has been laser processed into three-dimensional objects and surface protective coatings. Two novel fabrication systems were designed to build threedimensional objects, namely tower nozzle solid freeform fabrication system and axissymmetric laser powder deposition system. W-Ti-C alloy based protective coatings were deposited on graphite substrates, through laser melting of pre-placed powder mixture, to widen the use of carbon structural elements for high temperature applications. A method for depositing W-Ti-C alloy on steel using multi-intermediate layers strategy is discussed and the preliminary results are presented in this study.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effect of double interspiking on fertility, behavior, and blood parameters in broiler breeder males reared under heat stress conditions</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Chung, Karianne Mei-Ying</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Broiler breeders experience a natural decline in fertility levels as a flock ages.  A male management practice such as double interspiking could be applied to counteract this decline.  Our objective was to investigate the effects of double interspiking on flock fertility, testosterone concentrations, stress responses, and behavioral responses of broiler breeders in heat stressed environments.  Two hundred and eighty-eight broiler breeder pullets and thirty-six broiler breeder roosters (Ross 708) were assigned to three groups at 21 weeks of age (WOA).  All three groups were housed in slatted floor pens in which room temperature cycled from 23.8 to 30 C to mimic heat stressed environments.  Double interspiking was carried out between two pens at 42 and 52 WOA.  Beginning at 32 WOA, eggs were set every two weeks, candled at day 12, and percent fertility calculated.  Concentrations of the hormones testosterone and corticosterone (CS) were measured by radioimmunoassays at specific time points in the experiment.  Lymphocytes and heterophils were counted in order to calculate heterophil:lymphocyte (H:L) ratios.  Behavior was monitored with Panasonic video cameras which recorded video footage using the Noldus MPEG Recorder from 1900 hr to 2100 hr at specific time points.  Recordings were analyzed, and frequency of specific behavioral responses of individual (preening, feather ruffling, wing flapping), male-to-male (fighting, pecking, retreating), and male-to-female (attempted and completed mating) behaviors were assessed.  The introduction of unfamiliar roosters resulted in a fertility increase (P&lt;0.01) between control and spiked birds after the first interspike and a sustainment of fertility levels after the second interspike.  Testosterone concentrations declined (P&lt;0.0001) from 1.95ng/mL to 0.11ng/mL as the birds aged. Corticosterone concentrations differed among bird groups and was elevated (P=.0333) for both groups that were interspiked.  H:L ratios were also different among bird groups with all birds housed in the interspiked rooms showing higher ratios.  Double interspiking increased the occurrence of male-to-male interactions, but there were no significant differences in male-to-female or individual behaviors.  Regardless of treatment, there was a decrease in male-to-female behaviors as the birds aged.  Double interspiking does show promise as a tool to increase fertility levels in a broiler breeder flock.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Evaluation of Losses in HID Electronic Ballast Using Silicon Carbide MOSFETs</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Gopi Reddy, Lakshmi Reddy</dc:creator>
<dc:description>HID lamps are used in applications where high luminous intensity is desired. They are used in a wide range of applications from gymnasiums to movie theatres, from parking lots to indoor aquaria, from vehicle headlights to indoor gardening. They require ballasts during start-up and also during operation to regulate the voltage and current levels. Electronic ballasts have advantages of less weight, smooth operation, and less noisy over electromagnetic ballasts. A number of topologies are available for the electronic ballast where control of power electronic devices is exploited to achieve the performance of a ballast for lighting. A typical electronic ballast consists of a rectifier, power factor control unit, and the resonant converter unit. Power factor correction (PFC) was achieved using a boost converter topology and average current mode control for gate control of the boost MOSFET operating at a frequency of 70 kHz. The PFC was tested with Si and SiC MOSFET at 250 W resistive load for varying input from 90 V to 264 V. An efficiency as high as 97.4% was achieved by Si MOSFET based PFC unit. However, for SiC MOSFET, the efficiency decreased and was lower than expected. A maximum efficiency of 97.2% was achieved with the SiC based PFC. A simulation model was developed for both Si and SiC MOSFET based ballasts. The efficiency plots are presented. A faster gate drive for SiC MOSFET could improve the efficiency of the SiC based systems.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Lind, Rebecca A</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Steel plate shear walls are investigated as a lateral load resisting system with particular interest towards seismic loads. Past physical testing is studied in order to determine trends in failure modes and design considerations. Analysis is conducted on data from two, large scale, steel plate shear walls that were tested under quasi-static loading. The investigation includes energy dissipation, axial forces in members, bending moment, curvature, infill stresses, and shear distribution. Recommendations are made for future projects.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Accuracy of Physical Activity Monitors in Pregnant Women</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Connolly, Christopher P</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Purpose: To determine the step count accuracy of three pedometers and one accelerometer in pregnant women during treadmill walking.  Methods: Subjects were 30 women in the second or third trimester (20-36 weeks) who were screened for pregnancy-related risk factors.  Each subject was fitted with a belt containing three physical activity monitors:  Yamax Digiwalker SW-200 (DW), New Lifestyles NL 2000 (NL), and GT3X Actigraph accelerometer (ACT).  The Omron HJ-720 (HJ) was placed in the pants pocket.  Subjects walked at 54, 67, 80, and 94 m•min-1 for two minutes each.  Actual steps were determined by an investigator using a hand-tally counter.  Percentage of actual steps was calculated for each device at each speed and compared.  Results: There was a significant interaction between speed and device (F9,20=7.574,P&lt;0.001).  At all speeds, the NL and HJ were most accurate.  At 54 m•min-1, the DW was significantly less accurate (P&lt;0.001) than all other devices and the ACT was significantly less accurate (P&lt;0.001) than the NL and HJ.  At 67 m•min-1, the ACT and DW were significantly less accurate (P&lt;0.001) than the NL and HJ.  At 80 m•min-1, the DW was significantly less accurate (P=0.024) than the NL and HJ.  At 94 m•min-1, the ACT was significantly less accurate (P=0.001) than the NL and HJ.  No significant differences were found at any speed for the NL (P=0.996) and HJ (P=0.298).  Trimester did not significantly affect device accuracy.  Conclusion: In pregnant women, the ACT and DW are less accurate than the NL and HJ.  The HJ appeared to be the most accurate.  These results can be useful in developing further research studies and physical activity programs that focus on walking during pregnancy.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Captive to the American Woods: Sarah Wakefield and Cultural Mediation</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hunt, Sophia Betsworth</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The life and narrative of Sarah Wakefield, an Anglo migrant who spent six weeks as a captive of the Santee Dakotas during the US-Dakota Conflict, show one woman's experience navigating the changing racial dynamics of the nineteenth-century Minnesota frontier. Using recent conceptualizations of “the frontier” as either a middle ground or woods, this thesis reconsiders Wakefield as a prisoner, not of Indians or her own conscience but of her region‟s ossifying racial divisions. Wakefield's initial attempts at intercultural communication, which included feeding starving Dakotas who knocked on her door, were consistent with Anglo notions about womanhood and Indian-white relations. But when war forced Wakefield into captivity and heightened racial tensions in Minnesota, Wakefield‟s decision to seek protection as the “wife” of an Indian male jumped the boundaries of what the white community would tolerate. Wakefield wrote her captivity narrative after she had returned to her Anglo community, her Indian protector had died by public execution, and the United States government had removed most other Dakotas from the state. While on the surface Wakefield‟s work appears to be courageously pro-Indian, it was in fact an attempt to reconcile herself with other white Minnesotans by proving her adherence to popular notions of racial difference and female propriety. Rather than the defender of cultural pluralism that previous scholars have made her out to be, Wakefield was a pragmatist whose quest for community ultimately overshadowed her willingness to bridge the cultural divide. Her story suggests the limits of intercultural exchange on the frontier and the process by which ideas about race both created and intensified these barriers.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Understanding the Sources of Abnormal Returns from the Momentum Strategy.</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Zhang, Yu</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis studies the sources of the returns from the momentum strategy and attempts to find some hints for the heated debate on the market efficiency hypothesis over the past twenty years.  By decomposing the momentum returns from a mathematical model, we investigate directly the contributors and their relative importance in generating these momentum returns.
Our empirical results support that autocorrelation of own stock returns is one of the driving forces for the momentum expected returns.  The magnitude of the autocorrelation decreases as the ranking period becomes more remote.  The second important source comes from the cross-sectional variation of the expected returns in the winner and loser portfolios at a given time.  The third important source is the difference of the expected returns between the winner and loser portfolios.   To our surprise, the cross-autocovariance does not contribute much to the momentum expected returns.  Thus, the lead-lag effect can cause momentum returns, but its impact is not as significant as we had anticipated.
More importantly, by changing the weights of the winner and loser portfolios, we find that the own-autocovariance of the winner portfolio is almost negligible, compared to that of the loser portfolio.  The returns of the winners are much more random than those of the losers.  This asymmetric own-autocovariance found in the return decomposition provides another underlying explanation to the recent finding that the contribution of the winner and loser portfolios to the momentum returns is asymmetric, and it is the losers, rather than the winners, that drive the momentum returns.
Therefore, the market may not be as efficient as we believed before.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Experimental Aerodynamic Analysis of Converging Free Jets</dc:title>
<dc:creator>McBee, Nathanael Tate</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The setup of the converging jets is commonly used in the manufacture of meltblown fibers. This requires forced airflow through small channels angled toward each other until meeting at the exit of the die. The emerging air jets impinge while molten polymer is extruded and becomes entrained in the air flow to be collected downstream as a thin cooled fiber.
The experimental analysis of converging free jets was examined to reveal characteristics of the flow field. A hot-film anemometer was used to gather and analyze the corresponding data for two separate meltblown fiber dies. These were examined and compared to each other as well as previous computational fluid dynamics studies of similar setups.
A traverse system was used to position the anemometer probe while measurements of the mean velocity and turbulence intensity were obtained at varying positions throughout the flow fields. This data was analyzed and compared to existing studies and theoretical prediction and was found to agree with existing computer models by showing three distinct regions: the first zone where each emerging jet maintains individual velocity profiles; a second mixing zone of maximum turbulence and an intermediate velocity profile; and a third zone where the individual jets are no longer present and the velocity profile becomes characteristic of a theoretical single emerging jet of similar mass flow rate.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Economic Impacts of Production, Storage, Transport, and Conversion of Switchgrass for Cellulosic Ethanol in Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Fulton, Adam David</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The goal of this study is to evaluate the introduction of cellulosic ethanol conversion plants using switchgrass as the feedstock and how it impacts the economies of two Tennessee regions.  Switchgrass feedstock production, storage, and transportation costs are estimated for one plant in West Tennessee and one plant in East Tennessee.  In each region, the location for a cellulosic ethanol conversion plant and the acreage required to meet a 61.8 million-gallon/year capacity are specified.  The costs associated with switchgrass production and cellulosic ethanol conversion are then entered into IMPLAN to estimate the economic impacts of one cellulosic ethanol plant in each region.
The key findings of the study for West Tennessee are as follows.  The investment impacts of switchgrass farming are $100.4 million more in total industry output, an increase of 914 jobs, and $46.9 million more in total valued added.  Investment impacts of a cellulosic ethanol conversion plant include $121.3 million increase in total industry output, an additional 653 jobs, and a $47.7 million increase in total valued added.  Year-to-year operations of switchgrass farming and cellulosic ethanol conversion increase the region’s total industry output by $57.1 million, increase jobs by 296, and increase total value added by $26 million.
In East Tennessee the investment impacts of switchgrass farming are $118.3 million increase in total industry output, 949 jobs created, and a $66.4 million increase in total valued added.  Investment impacts of a cellulosic ethanol conversion plant include a $116.9 million increase in total industry output, an additional 765 jobs, and a $48.3 million increase in total valued added.  Year-to-year operations of switchgrass farming and cellulosic ethanol conversion increase the region’s total industry output by $80.4 million, jobs by 396, and the total value added by $39.2 million.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Non-thermal Plasma Inactivation of Bacillus Amyloliquefaciens spores</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Huang, Yaohua</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Bacterial spores have remarkable resistance to a variety of harsh conditions, causing spoilage in food industry and becoming the primary bacterial agent in biowarfare and bioterrorism. In this study, inactivation mechanisms of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (BA) spores by non-thermal plasma (NTP) were investigated by using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) as a major tool to exam spores after NTP treatment. Chemometric techniques, such as multivariate classification models based on soft independent modeling of Class Analogy (SIMCA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), were employed to identify functional group changes in FTIR spectra. The IR absorbance bands correlated to dipicolinic acid (DPA) decreased after NTP treatment indicating that DPA released and then reacted with reactive species generated by NTP and it was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Also IR absorbance bands corresponding to protein structure changed. FTIR combined with UV-Vis spectroscopy was used to monitor spore germination. Large amount of DPA released in a short time when spores germinated at 50°C, showing that DPA released in response to heating. NTP treated spores could germinate with little DPA release due to sub-lethal effects induced by plasma. Also an empirical model based on Weibull distribution was established to describe the spore germination process showing that NTP treated spores exhibited abnormal germination pattern. Inactivation mechanisms of NTP with air as feed gas was compared with high-pressure, wet heat, chemical treatment using chlorine dioxide (CD) and NTP with argon as feed gas. The results showed that few chemical changes in spores after autoclave and high pressure treatments, though protein structure changed. CD and NTP with air as feed gas inactivated spores by oxidation. DPA released after NTP with argon as feed gas treatment and it is possible that UV and charged particles accounts for the inactivation. This study provides in depth insight into the inactivation mechanism of NTP and information for optimizing NTP process.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Therapy of Humiliation: Towards an Ethics of Humility in the works of J.M. Coetzee</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Mangat, Ajitpaul Singh</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This work asks how and for whom humiliation can be therapeutic. J. M. Coetzee, in his works Waiting for the Barbarians, Life &amp; Times of Michael K and Disgrace, does not simply critique the mentality of Empire, an “Enlightenment” or colonialist mode of knowing that knows no bounds to reason, but offers an alternative through the Magistrate, Michael K and David Lurie, all of whom are brutally shamed and “abjected”. Each character, I propose, experiences a Lacanian “therapy of humiliation” resulting in a subversion of their egos, which they come to understand as antagonistic, a site of misrecognition.  In doing so, these characters confront limitation, whether by means of a Lacanian “death drive” or the abjection of the self. I argue, this subversion of their egos necessitates a return to the humility of the body resulting in a new ethical openness to others and an engagement with the world through “care” or “love” or “beauty” which manifests as careful negotiation and attentiveness. Confrontation with death, thus, allows the Magistrate, Michael K and David Lurie to slough off “Enlightenment” values in favor of an anti-humanist way of living.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Structural and metamorphic evolution of the west-central Newton window, eastern Inner Piedmont, Burke, Catawba, and Lincoln Counties, North Carolina</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Gilliam, William George</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Rocks of the western and eastern Inner Piedmont, along with the eastern Blue Ridge, comprise the Neoacadian metamorphic core of the southern Appalachians. The composite Inner Piedmont consists of the eastern Tugaloo (western Inner Piedmont) and Cat Square (eastern Inner Piedmont) terranes, which are separated by the Brindle Creek fault. Geochronologic evidence established the Brindle Creek fault as a terrane boundary within the Inner Piedmont, separating terranes of Laurentian and mixed Laurentian/Avalonian (peri-Gondwanan) zircon suites. The Newton window exposes Tugaloo terrane rocks of the Tallulah Falls Formation in the footwall of the Brindle Creek thrust sheet.
Detailed geologic mapping in the western Newton window revealed structural and metamorphic similarities between rocks across the Brindle Creek fault. Peak metamorphism occurred contemporaneously with peak deformation, reaching upper amphibolite facies across both terranes. Peak Neoacadian metamorphism occurred between 360 and 345 Ma. Electron microprobe analyses of Cat Square terrane core and rim garnet-biotite and garnet-plagioclase pairs indicate an average temperature and pressure of 620 C, 3.6 kbar and 710 C, 6.1 kbar, respectively. Temperature and pressure estimates from the lower Tallulah Falls Formation core and rim analyses yield conditions of 570 C, 4.1 kbar and 690 C, 5.9 kbar, respectively.  The maximum burial depth for both Cat Square and Tugaloo terrane rocks is ~20 km. The range in metamorphic ages suggests subduction and accretion occurred at a rate of 1 kilometer per 1.75 million years.
Six deformational events shaped the western Newton window. D1 features are limited to amphibolite boudins of the Tugaloo terrane. D2 regional penetrative structures such as high-temperature foliations, mineral stretching lineations, and curved fold axes are the product of Neoacadian tectonism. The dominant S2 foliation trends north-northwest and dips moderately to the west-southwest. North-northwest-trending L2 mineral lineations parallel F2 fold axes, creating a curved map pattern recording crustal flow in an ancient orogenic channel.  D3 resulted in open folding. The D4 event produced regional open folds. D5 and D6 features occur as joints, cataclasis, and diabase intrusion.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Enterprise Users and Web Search Behavior</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lewis, April Ann</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis describes analysis of user web query behavior associated with Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s (ORNL) Enterprise Search System (Hereafter, ORNL Intranet). The ORNL Intranet provides users a means to search all kinds of data stores for relevant business and research information using a single query. The Global Intranet Trends for 2010 Report suggests the biggest current obstacle for corporate intranets is “findability and Siloed content”. Intranets differ from internets in the way they create, control, and share content which can make it often difficult and sometimes impossible for users to find information. Stenmark (2006) first noted studies of corporate internal search behavior is lacking and so appealed for more published research on the subject.
This study employs mature scientific internet web query transaction log analysis (TLA) to examine how corporate intranet users at ORNL search for information. The focus of the study is to better understand general search behaviors and to identify unique trends associated with query composition and vocabulary. The results are compared to published Intranet studies. A literature review suggests only a handful of intranet based web search studies exist and each focus largely on a single aspect of intranet search. This implies that the ORNL study is the first to comprehensively analyze a corporate intranet user web query corpus, providing results to the public.
This study analyzes 65,000 user queries submitted to the ORNL intranet from September 17, 2007 through December 31, 2007. A granular relational data model first introduced by Wang, Berry, and Yang (2003) for Web query analysis was adopted and modified for data mining and analysis of the ORNL query corpus. The ORNL query corpus is characterized using Zipf Distributions, descriptive word statistics, and Mutual Information. User search vocabulary is analyzed using frequency distribution and probability statistics.
The results showed that ORNL users searched for unique types of information. ORNL users are uncertain of how to best formulate queries and don’t use search interface tools to narrow search scope. Special domain language comprised 38% of the queries. The average results returned per query for ORNL were too high and no hits occurred 16.34%.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effects of Environmental Stress on Growth, Yield, and Flavonolignan Content in Milk Thistle &lt;em&gt;Silybum marianum&lt;/em&gt; L. Gaertn</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Belitz, Amy Renae</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Four experiments were performed in a greenhouse or growth chamber to study the quantity and quality of flavonolignans in response to environmental stress in milk thistle (Silybum marianum L., Gaertn.). A preliminary experiment was conducted in spring 2004 to study effects of leaf harvests on growth, development, and flavonolignan content in milk thistle seeds. Taxifolin, a component of silymarin and precursor to flavonolignans, was significantly reduced due to leaf harvest treatments.
The weedy nature (sporadic germination) of Silybum made germinating enough plants for experimentation problematic. Initial germination studies to determine imbibition and pre-chilling requirements were inconclusive due to heavy fungal infections. A sterilization procedure was chosen to treat seeds before experimental use and flavonolignan analysis. Germination trials were also performed with seven other seed sources. Seeds harvested in Croatia showed the best germination and were used for subsequent experiments.
Flavonolignans in Silybum seeds are reported to vary depending on environmental conditions and genetic diversity within a population. In another experiment, total silymarin concentrations determined from eight seed sources from around the world ranged from 29.6 to 56.9 mg/gram of seed meal. Individual flavonolignans varied significantly in and among seed sources.
In the first stress experiment was, plants were grown in pine bark media in polyethylene bags. Plant densities from 1-24 plants/bag were established. Immature and total seed counts and yields decreased with increasing density. Number of blooms per plant, bloom diameter, and mature seed count and yield were negatively correlated to density. There was no significant effect of plant density on flavonolignan content.
In the second stress experiment, milk thistle plants were grown in perlite in polyethylene bags. Water treatments (200, 650, 1100, 1550, and 2000 mL/day including fertigation) were created using pressure-compensated emitters. The lowest watering rate significantly reduced stem height and bloom diameter. The highest water treatment showed the highest count of immature seeds. In primary blooms, the lowest water rate yielded the highest taxifolin concentration (0.89 mg/g). Flavonolignan content was not significantly affected in secondary blooms.
Silybum growth and development was affected by environmental stress. However, no significant effect on silymarin concentration or composition was established.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An Applied Statistical Reliability Analysis of the Modulus of Elasticity and the Modulus of Rupture for Wood-Plastic Composites</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Perhac, Diane Goodman</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Wood-plastic composites (WPC) are materials comprised of wood fiber within a thermoplastic matrix and are a growing and important source of alternative wood products in the forest products industry. WPC is gaining market share in the building industry because of durability/maintenance advantages of WPC over traditional wood products and because of the removal of chromated copper arsenate (CCA) pressuretreated wood from the market. The reliability methods outlined in this thesis can be used to improve the quality of WPC and lower manufacturing costs by reducing raw material inputs and minimizing WPC waste. Statistical methods are described for analyzing both tensile strength and bending measures of WPC. These key measures include stiffness (tangent modulus of elasticity: MOE) and flexural strength (modulus of rupture: MOR) results from both tensile strength and bending tests. As with any real data analysis, the possibility of outliers is assessed and addressed. With this data, different WPC subsets are evaluated with and without the presence of a coupling agent. Separate subsets without outliers are also reviewed. Descriptive statistics, histograms, probability plots, and survival curves from these test data are presented and interpreted. To provide a more objective assessment of appropriate parametric modeling, Akaike’s Information Criterion is used in conjunction with probability plotting. Selection of the best underlying distribution for the data is an important result that may be used to further explore and analyze the given data. In this thesis, these underlying distributional assumptions are utilized to better understand the product’s lower percentiles.
These lower percentiles provide practitioners with an evaluation of the product’s early failures along with providing information for specification limits, warranty, and cost analysis. Estimation of lower percentiles is sometimes difficult, since substantive data is often sparse in the lower tails. Bootstrap techniques provide important solutions for confidence interval assessments of these percentiles. Bootstrapping is a computer intensive resampling method that may be used for both parametric and nonparametric models. This thesis briefly describes several bootstrapping methods and applies these methods to appraise MOE and MOR test results on sampled WPC. The reliability and bootstrapping methods outlined in this thesis may directly benefit WPC manufacturers through a better evaluation of strength and stiffness measures, which can lead to process improvements with enhanced reliability, thereby creating greater manufacturer and customer satisfaction.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Formation and Characterization of Polymerized Supported Phospholipid Bilayers and the in vitro Interactions of Macrophages and Fibroblasts.</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Page, Jonathan Michael</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Planar supported, polymerized phospholipid bilayers (PPBs) composed of 1,2-bis[10-(2’,4’-hexadienoyloxy)decanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (bis-SorbPC or BSPC) were generated by a redox polymerization method.  The PPBs were supported by a silicon substrate.  The PPBs were characterized and tested for uniformity and stability under physiological conditions.  The PPBs were analyzed in vitro with murine derived cells that are pertinent to the host response.  Cellular attachment and phenotypic changes in RAW 264.7 macrophages and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were investigated on PPBs and compared to bare silicon controls.  Fluorescent and SEM images were used to observe cellular attachment and changes in cellular behavior.  The PPBs showed much lower cellular adhesion for both cell lines than bare silicon controls.  Of the cells that attached to the PPBs, a very low percentage showed the same morphological expressions as seen on the controls.  The hypothesis generated from this work is that defects in the PPBs mediated the cellular attachment and morphological changes that were observed.   Finally, a layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition of a poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) (PNVP) alternating bilayer was attempted as a proof of concept for future modification of this system.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Nuclear Receptors in Ecdysone-mediated Programmed Cell Death in Drosophila melanogaster</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sehgal, Ritika</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The steroid hormone ecdysone plays vital roles during Drosophila development. Pulses of 20E during Drosophila life cycle function as temporal cues, signaling the onset of metamorphic processes, including the stage specific programmed cell death of larval tissues. Ecdysone is the critical developmental cue orchestrating the metamorphic reformation of CNS, resulting in the formation of adult-specific neural circuitry. Ecdysone signaling is transduced by a heterodimeric receptor complex formed between two nuclear receptors: EcR and Ultraspiracle (USP). There are 18 nuclear receptors known in Drosophila and EcR is the only receptor whose functions in neuronal PCD have been well recognized. Therefore, the current study is aimed to define the role of nuclear receptors in neuronal cell death mechanisms in Drosophila. Here, I examine the function of nuclear receptors in PCD of two groups of peptidergic neurons: vCrz and CCAP.
EcR and USP receptor complex on activation results in the coordinated transcriptional regulation of a host of transcription factors regulating genes essential for PCD. USP plays a dual role in ecdysone response, as its function is necessary for both activation and repression of ecdysone primary response genes. I have developed a possible dominant-negative mutant USP (usp3), and expressed it in ﬂies using the GAL4-UAS system to illustrate the role of USP in ecdysone mediated PCD of vCrz neurons. Targeted expression of usp3 in corazonin neurons results in a complete blockage of PCD pathway. Another interacting partner of USP, Drosophila Hormone Receptor 38, however shows no involvement in PCD of vCrz neurons. I have also designed an ecdysone sensor to monitor the developmental timing of EcR activation in vCrz neurons.
Further, I investigate the survival factors required for preventing the untimely PCD of these two groups of neurons. The study reveals that DIAP1 is required for the survival of larval vCrz and CCAP neurons. Also, the nuclear receptor E75 is shown to be critical for preventing premature PCD of CCAP neurons.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Analytical Computation of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Modes and n-Width Approximations for the Heat Equation with Boundary Control</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Fernandez, Tasha N.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Model reduction is a powerful and ubiquitous tool used to reduce the complexity of a dynamical system while preserving the input-output behavior. It has been applied throughout many different disciplines, including controls, fluid and structural dynamics. Model reduction via proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is utilized for of control of partial differential equations. In this thesis, the analytical expressions of POD modes are derived for the heat equation. The autocorrelation function of the latter is viewed as the kernel of a self adjoint compact operator, and the POD modes and corresponding eigenvalues are computed by solving homogeneous integral equations of the second kind. The computed POD modes are compared to the modes obtained from snapshots for both the one-dimensional and two-dimensional heat equation. Boundary feedback control is obtained through reduced-order POD models of the heat equation and the effectiveness of reduced-order control is compared to the full-order control. Moreover, the explicit computation of the POD modes and eigenvalues are shown to allow the computation of different n-widths approximations for the heat equation, including the linear, Kolmogorov, Gelfand, and Bernstein n-widths.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Optimization of Digital Filter Design Using Hardware Accelerated Simulation</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Liang, Getao</dc:creator>
<dc:description>iii Abstract The goal to this research was to develop a scheme to optimize a digital filter design using an optimization engine and hardware-accelerated simulation using a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). A parameterizable generic digital filter, which was fully implemented on a prototyping board with a Xilinx Virtex-II Pro xc2vp30-7-ff896 FPGA, was developed using Xilinx System Generator for DSP. The optimization engine, which actually is a random candidate generator that will eventually be replaced by a differential evolution engine, was implemented using MATLAB along with a candidate evaluator and other supporting programs. Automatic hardware co-simulations of 100 candidate filters were performed successfully to demonstrate that this approach is feasible, reliable and efficient for complex systems.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Exploring the Career Mobility of Women in Campus Recreation</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hobart, Jessica Michelle</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis is a quantitative research design that examines the upward mobility of women administrators in campus recreation.  The purpose of this study is to examine the career mobility of women currently working in the administration of campus recreation.  A criterion sampling method was used to select women currently holding administrative level positions in campus recreation as well as solicit participation using the National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association (NIRSA) Member Database.  The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS 18.0) was utilized to analyze the data.  For the quantitative data, basic descriptive statistics were performed which included means, standard deviations, and frequencies.  For the research questions Pearson Chi Square tests, ANOVA tests, and Tukey’s Post Hoc test were conducted.   The respondents’ narrative comments were analyzed objectively for common themes.  A total of 348 women administrators successfully completed the e-survey, generating a 45.7% response rate.  Some significant findings from this study include: (1) The current study supports the literature of previous studies in that women in different sport industry segments are experiencing the same barriers to career mobility; (2) Women still perceive the same challenges as women over 30 years ago; (3) The status of women has increasingly changed as women continue to make inroads into the campus recreation profession, however women’s perceived career development remains unchanged.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Survey of Public Garden Leaders</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Pulte, Andrew J</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Leadership and leadership development is an important topic facing those who lead and train people in the area of public horticulture. In the fall of 2007 an email survey consisting of 55 questions was sent to 448 executive directors of public gardens in the United States. This survey was divided into six major sections: demographics on each director‟s garden and their association with their garden; each directors view of leadership in their garden and in the field of public horticulture; each directors experience with, and their view on the importance of internships; leadership style; each directors level of confidence, and their views on the importance of different aspects of their job; general personal demographic information and each directors‟ comments.
Results from this study suggest current garden directors have an interest in furthering their own knowledge in the area of leadership. The results from this study also revealed leaders of public gardens in the U.S. lead using a participative style of leadership. This style of leadership fosters an environment where subordinates opinions are taken into consideration when making decisions. Respondents to this study also value experiences during college at a high level in regards to choosing their career path. This includes participation in hands-on work experiences such as internships. In conclusion, those who currently lead public gardens typically feel that the ability to communicate is the most important aspect of what they do. Unfortunately, this is also an area where current directors lack personal confidence and desire professional development.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Impact of Organizational Attributes on Project Performance as Measured by On-Time Delivery and Budget</dc:title>
<dc:creator>El-Akkad, Zeid</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Before we determine what lean tools are suitable for an office environment and how to modify those tools to make them more suitable and in order to develop a lean office, it is important to understand the different processes and aspects within an office. For this reason, better understanding of office processes and aspects helps facilitate the deployment and implementation and modification of different lean techniques to better suit the office environment. The purpose of this paper is to identify seven different factors to compare against one another and against project performance in terms of on-time delivery and budget. The seven factors are as follows: business sector, size of the organization, office layout, information processing, data flow, location, and interaction or lack of interaction among various departments within an organization. A hypothesis will be developed regarding each of these factors, and subsequently a survey will be created and conducted. A statistical analysis of this survey will be done using primarily a Chi Square test to determine whether our hypotheses can be validated by the data.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Design and Implementation of a Signal Conditioning Operational Amplifier for a Reflective Object Sensor</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Master, Ankit</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Industrial systems often require the acquisition of real-world analog signals for several applications.  Various physical phenomena such as displacement, pressure, temperature, light intensity, etc. are measured by sensors, which is a type of transducer, and then converted into a corresponding electrical signal. The electrical signal obtained from the sensor, usually a few tens mV in magnitude, is subsequently conditioned by means of amplification, filtering, range matching, isolation etc., so that the signal can be rendered for further processing and data extraction.
This thesis presents the design and implementation of a general purpose op amp used to condition a reflective object sensor’s output. The op amp is used in a non-inverting configuration, as a current-to-voltage converter to transform a phototransistor current into a usable voltage. The op amp has been implemented using CMOS architecture and fabricated in AMI 0.5-µm CMOS process available through MOSIS.
The thesis begins with an overview of the various circuits involving op amps used in signal conditioning circuits. Owing to the vast number of applications for sensor signal conditioning circuits, a brief discussion of an industrial sensor circuit is also illustrated. This is followed by the complete design of the op amp and its implementation in the data acquisition circuit. The op amp is then characterized using simulation results. Finally, the test setup and the measurement results are presented. The thesis concludes with an overview of some possible future work on the sensor-op amp data acquisition circuit.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>With and Against: Architecture Jazz Mondrian</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Draper, Charles Mark</dc:creator>
<dc:description>My thesis centers around the painter Piet Mondrian and a prophetic position that he held at the end of his life that architecture and painting could be united sometime in the future through the introduction of sound, namely jazz music. This is a test if a synthesis between art, architecture, site, space, content, and structure can be elicited by the infusion of jazz, rhythm, arythmos, and syncopation. The metaphorical aspect of synthesis is imperative for the current state of art and architecture and ultimately a bridge between sensory inputs and a sensorial unconscious can be reduced to a larger analogy of a bridge between the body and the soul.
Drummer Art Blakey said, “Jazz is known all over the world as an American musical art form and that’s it. No America, no Jazz.”</dc:description>

			<dc:title>We're Still Here: Culturally Sensitive Design and Planning</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Cooper, Ezekiel Craig</dc:creator>
<dc:description>“In the 1700’s it was impossible to visit what is now known as western North Carolina without encountering the Cherokee.  For the well traveled, it still is.” 
In 2007, the above quote was used in a marketing campaign by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians to attract tourists to the town of Cherokee, NC.  Beginning in the early 1900’s, Cherokee evolved into a tourist destination because of the beautiful location, the historical importance and the offering of authentic cultural attractions.  Millions of people traveled to Cherokee throughout the 1900’s just to get a glimpse of Cherokee life and be exposed to the Cherokee people of today.  However, over the past few years, most visitors are attracted to Cherokee for the chance of striking it rich at Harrah’s Cherokee Casino.
The purpose of this thesis is to redevelop a strategic site in Cherokee that will serve as a central marketplace for the town.  This area should be designed in a way that is respectful and reflective of the Cherokee people, their history and their culture.  This site will serve as a hub to visitors and a location for local residents to utilize on a day-to-day basis.  This site will serve as a template for future development and redevelopment in the town that in hopes will restore a very special “Sense of Place.”</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Inverse Kinematics Based on Fuzzy Logic and Neural Networks for the WAM-Titan II Teleoperation System</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Park, Joong-kyoo</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The inverse kinematic problem is crucial for robotics. In this paper, a solution algorithm is presented using artificial intelligence to improve the pseudo-inverse Jacobian calculation for the 7-DOF Whole Arm Manipulator (WAM) and 6-DOF Titan II teleoperation system. An investigation of the inverse kinematics based on fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks for the teleoperation system was undertaken. Various methods such as Adaptive Neural-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Genetic Algorithms (GA), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) Feedforward Networks, Radial Basis Function Networks (RBF) and Generalized Regression Neural Networks (GRNN) were tested and simulated using MATLAB. Each method for identification of the pseudo-inverse problem was tested, and the best method was selected from the simulation results and the error analysis.
From the results, the Multilayer Perceptrons with Levenberg-Marquardt (MLP-LM) method had the smallest error and the fastest computation among the other methods. For the WAM-Titan II teleoperation system, the new inverse kinematics calculations for the Titan II were simulated and analyzed using MATLAB. Finally, extensive C code for the alternative algorithm was developed, and the inverse kinematics based on the artificial neural network with LM method is implemented in the real system. The maximum error of Cartesian position was 1.3 inches, and from several trajectories, 75 % of time implementation was achieved compared to the conventional method. Because fast performance of a real time system in the teleoperation is vital, these results show that the new inverse kinematics method based on the MLP-LM is very successful with the acceptable error.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Reviving Community Identity using Movement in and through Public Space</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Strong, Nekia</dc:creator>
<dc:description>“…the interweaving of human patterns. They are full of people doing different things, with different reasons and different ends in view, and the architecture reflects and expresses this difference...Being human, human beings are what interest us most. In architecture as in literature and the drama, it is the richness of human variation that gives vitality and color to the human setting…” – Raskin (Jacobs 229)
This thesis asserts that the greater opportunity for people to interact socially, the greater sense of identity a community has. Over time, as historically defined public space has been in decline, so has the level of common knowledge about other cultures and people. A healthy sense of community goes hand in hand with good urban design to promote health, safety, and warm spirits in a neighborhood’s inhabitants.
The goal of this thesis is to increase communal interaction by (re)introducing public space within the contemporary American neighborhood, by way of a hybrid program of public transit, community center, retail and green space. The respectful relationship between public space and the surrounding architecture becomes a catalyst for similar relationships formed by the users in casual meetings, impromptu games, or organized get-together times.
This site of this study is within the limits of the Grant Park neighborhood in southeast Atlanta, Georgia. This area of the city is one of much potential, but has been overlooked in recent development for the more wealthy areas north of downtown. With historic Grant Park and Zoo Atlanta within its borders, this inner ring community has potential as being a model of diversity, but its pockets of uses are separated by lack of uniting common spaces in which to move about and interact.
This proposal stresses that recognizing the daily patterns of life, the ways at which people move throughout their day, is essential to developing more productive urban design. Nothing is experienced by itself, but always in relation to its surroundings, the sequences of events leading up to it, the memory of past experiences (Lynch 1). Comparative analysis of historic and contemporary urban plans provides a framework to design the Movement Center. By diagramming the characteristics of movement through the site, we can look to develop ways to maximize opportunities for people to intermingle in their paths through public spaces at a pedestrian scale.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of creating this Multi-Hazard Mitigation Disaster Resistant University Plan is to meet the requirements of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000. This hazard mitigation plan documents the process of creating a plan for the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, including identifying hazards and risks associated with UTK and identifying a hazard mitigation strategy specific to UTK that will lessen the campus’ vulnerability and make it more resistant to disaster and more sustainable. This plan identifies goals for hazard mitigation and risk reduction of natural and man-made hazards to UTK’s campus by following the planning guidelines and requirements as included in FEMA’s Multi-Hazard Mitigation Planning Guidance Under the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (March 2004; Revised November 2006). This plan was created using these FEMA-recommended guidelines of organizing resources, identifying hazards and assessing risks, developing a mitigation plan, and adopting and implementing the plan.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A New Approach to the &lt;em&gt;Devīmāhātmya&lt;/em&gt;: The Greatness of the Goddess in its Purāṇic Context</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Cecil, Elizabeth A</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Although the text of the Devīmāhātmya is itself a section of the Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa, recent scholarship has taken a primarily extrinsic approach to the text and its use by emphasizing the life of the Devīmāhātmya (henceforth DM) well apart from the textual tradition of the purāṇas. A reading of the DM in the context of the MārkP is instructive, because it reveals some interesting thematic connections that are indicative of larger thematic trends within the purāṇa, which prior extrinsic studies have not explored. Broadly speaking, these themes glorify women and Goddesses as positive manifestations of some fundamental female energy and efficacy. These themes occur in the DM and also occur in other narratives within the MārkP that praise female actors who restore order in times of crisis.
An evaluation of these thematic connections will show that the DM is best understood not only as an important text in its own right, but as an important piece of the MārkP as a whole. Conversely, the subject matter of the MārkP should not be viewed as unrelated to that of the DM. Therefore, my thesis is a preliminary effort to situate a text glorifying the Goddess in its purāṇic context through an analysis of narrative and thematic content.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Applied Stress Effects on the Isothermal and Cyclic High-Temperature Oxidation Behavior of Superalloys</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Barnard, Bryan R.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The effects of applied tensile stresses on the isothermal and cyclic oxidation behavior of two nickel-based superalloys, HAYNES® 75® and HAYNES® 230®, were investigated through measurements of specific mass change, oxide morphology and thickness, degree and depth of internal oxidation, compositional changes in and around the oxide scales, and x-ray diffraction. Here, an applied tensile stress generally led to larger Cr/Ni ratios in the oxide scales, greater chromium depletion in areas directly under the oxide scales, lower specific-mass-change values, and thinner oxide scales. These improvements in oxidation resistance are attributed to a greater concentration of dislocations, defects, etc. in the grain boundaries caused by the applied stress. These defects could act as fast diffusion paths for the Cr atoms to diffuse to the surface, causing a reduction in the duration of the less-protective transient-oxidation period and promoting faster formation of the more protective Cr2O3 layer.
Overall, the 230-alloy specimens demonstrated better oxidation and creep resistance than the 75-alloy specimens, likely due to their compositional differences, and the 230 alloy’s larger average grain size. The oxide scales of the 230-alloy specimens were generally thinner and formed at slower rates than those of the 75-alloy specimens. The 230-alloy specimens also demonstrated fewer internal oxidation penetrations than those of the 75 alloy under all conditions.
The effects of the applied stresses on the residual-stress states of substrates and surface oxides were characterized using x-ray diffraction. For both substrates and oxides, residual strains were compressive. Substrate residual strains were smaller in magnitude than those in the oxides due to relative thickness effects between oxide and substrate, and possibly to recovery and creep surface-residual-stress-relief processes in the substrate. For stressed specimens, these processes were possibly enhanced by dislocation creep. The residual stresses in the substrates were still compressive likely due to internal oxidation effects as well as a shallow x-ray penetration depth.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Archaeological and Dendrochronological Investigations at Cagle Saltpetre Cave, Van Buren County, Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Blankenship, Sarah Anne</dc:creator>
<dc:description>During the 19th century, the increasing demand for saltpeter, a vital ingredient in gunpowder, led to both large- and small-scale saltpeter-mining operations in caves throughout Tennessee. Although the general procedures in the historic processing of saltpeter are fairly well understood, very little archaeological research has been undertaken on specific saltpeter-mining sites. Historic documentation of mining activities within these caves is scarce, thus systematic studies of these sites are integral to a greater understanding of this early extractive industry. The research presented in this thesis is the first in the region in which archaeological and dendrochronological investigations were used in conjunction in an attempt to remedy this absence of formal study.
The dry environment of deep caves allows for excellent preservation of the material record, thus many saltpeter-mining sites still contain the equipment used in the mining operations, much of it still in context. The subject of this study, Cagle Saltpetre Cave, in Van Buren County, Tennessee, is one such site. My research design was focused on outlining the social history of the site, examining specific mining activities and saltpeter processing technologies employed, establishing specific temporal parameters for when the mining activities took place, and delineating changes in processing technology over time. Both archaeological and dendrochronological principles were employed to address these questions.
The archaeological investigation of Cagle Saltpetre Cave consisted of archival research, a comprehensive survey and mapping project, and Geographical Information Systems (GIS)-based data management and analyses. Archival research was conducted in an attempt to locate historic documentation of the mining operations at Cagle Saltpetre Cave. The cave was comprehensively surveyed and mapped in detail in order to document the location of prehistoric and historic cultural remains. The data generated from the mapping project were then examined for spatial patterns using GIS software. By documenting the spatial relationships of extant artifacts and features, information was gleaned to account for specific activities that took place at the site. In addition, these analyses allowed the reconstruction of other important aspects of the mining operations.
During the mining episodes at Cagle Saltpetre Cave, wooden leaching vats needed for the lixiviation of saltpeter, or calcium nitrate, from mined sediment were constructed and used within the cave. When mining operations ceased, these artifacts were abandoned and preserved in situ, some remaining virtually intact. Their remarkable preservation enabled tree-ring dating of timbers associated with these artifacts. The results of these analyses indicate that saltpeter was mined and processed at the site during three discrete episodes throughout the 19th century. Additionally, saltpeter-processing technology changed throughout the course of the mining operations.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Theoretical and Experimental Comparison of Aluminum as an Energetic Additive in Solid Rocket Motors with Thrust Stand Design</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Farrow, Derek Damon</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The use of aluminum as an energetic additive in solid rocket propellants has been around since the 1950’s. Since then, much research has been done both on the aluminum material itself and on chemical techniques to properly prepare aluminum particles for injection into a solid propellant. Although initial interests in additives were centered on space limited applications, performance increases opened the door for higher performance systems without the need to remake current systems. This thesis aims to compare the performance for aluminized solid rocket motors and non-aluminized motors, as well as focuses on design considerations for a thrust stand that can be created easily at low cost for initial testing. A theoretical model is created for predicting propellant performance and the results are compared with experimental data taken from the thrust stand as well as existing data. What is seen at the end of testing is the non-aluminized grains follow the same trends as previously conducted tests and firings. The aluminized grains follow their expected trend but at a lower performance level due to grain degradation. However, the aluminized grains still show a specific impulse  increase of 6%-23% over the non-aluminized grains.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An improved tissue culture and transformation system for switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.)</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Burris, Jason Neil</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), a summer perennial grass native to North America, is currently being explored for its potential use in the production of biofuels.   With these interests, genetic manipulation of switchgrass to produce plants that are easier to digest, have an increased resistance to diseases and stresses, and maintain viability longer in the field are required.  Therefore, it was necessary to develop a reliable and efficient tissue culture system for the transformation of switchgrass.  Current switchgrass tissue culture requires months for regeneration of transformants with relatively poor transformation efficiencies and are limited to derivatives of a single variety, Alamo. We have developed a tissue culture system, utilizing a novel media, LP9, which has demonstrated decreased time to the production of whole transgenic plants and with an increased efficiency.  LP9 is not an MSO-based tissue culture system.  It is comprised of both N6 macroelements and B5 microelements with the auxin, 2,4-D and does not include any cytokinin.  After just 1 month on LP9 media, callus can be selected and used for Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation or particle bombardment, and plants can be regenerated within 3 weeks of callus initiation.  Our system is unique to previously explored MSO-based systems in that it is optimized for the production of type II callus, which has been shown to produce higher transformation efficiencies in other monocots. We have increased the transformation efficiency of switchgrass from to up to 4% to 34% efficiency by selecting for this type of callus.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Correlating Grain Boundary Microstructure and Ductility Loss on Aging in Haynes® 25</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Glanton, Darryl Britt</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Haynes® 25 is a cobalt-base superalloy known for its excellent high temperature strength and corrosion resistance. However, this alloy undergoes severe embrittlement on aging at elevated temperatures. Historical research associated this ductility loss with the formation of a Co2W Laves phase, but more recent studies have challenged the existence of this phase after prolonged aging at temperatures above 600°C. In this study, scanning and transmission electron microscopy were used to characterize the chemistry and location of precipitates in the alloy after aging at temperatures of 675 and 850°C for times up to 12,000 hours. These data were compared with tensile data from the same heat of material in an attempt to develop quantitative relationships between microstructural observations and ductility loss. It was found that the change in fractional coverage of the grain boundaries by a M6C carbide precipitate (composition W3Co1.5Cr1.5C) on aging correlates well with ductility loss on aging at 850°C. The change in fractional coverage on aging at 675°C did not correlate as well, suggesting that the prevalent mechanism for ductility loss at this temperature may not be the precipitation reaction.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Twentieth Century Changes in the Climate Response of Yellow Pines in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee, U.S.A.</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Biermann, Christine Patricia</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Previous dendroclimatological research has shown that tree growth is primarily a function of temperature and precipitation. At mid-latitude temperate forest sites, trees have been found to be mainly moisture-sensitive rather than temperature-sensitive. Researchers at the 2007 North American Dendroecological Fieldweek were surprised to find a winter temperature signal in a shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) chronology from Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee. Building on this finding, I evaluated yellow pine climate-tree growth relationships at five sites on the western end of Great Smoky Mountains National Park using correlation, response function, moving correlation, and wavelet analyses. Winter mean minimum temperatures influenced yellow pine growth at all five sites, but spring precipitation and growing season moisture conditions also affected growth. Growth was positively associated with Atlantic Ocean sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) and North Atlantic Ocean (NAO) index values, suggesting that positive phases of the both the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and the NAO lead to above average annual tree growth. Pacific Ocean climate variability did not have a strong influence on yellow pine growth in Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
Climate-growth relationships were temporally unstable at all of the five sites. In the mid-20th century, the response to growing season precipitation and moisture conditions weakened. Simultaneously, the response to winter and fall mean minimum temperatures strengthened. The shift may have been caused by an AMO phase change, age-dependent climate responses, changes in phenology, decreased drought frequency, data quality, or atmospheric pollution. Because the relationship with temperaturestrengthened since 1950, yellow pines in Great Smoky Mountains National Park do not show evidence of divergence between temperature and tree growth. Still, this network of chronologies is not ideal for climate reconstruction because the climate-growth relationships were unstable over time. In the future, climate analysis of other chronologies from the southeastern U.S. will be necessary to determine whether the mid- 20th century shift in climate response at Great Smoky Mountains National Park occurred throughout the region.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas: Rethinking Economic Integration After the Failures of Neoliberalism</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Williams, Shannon D.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The deteriorating societal conditions that have accompanied the implementation of the neoliberal model in Latin America have been well documented. This analysis draws heavily on this work to identify the emergence of de-industrialization, displacement of food production, exclusion of basic human services, and excessive unemployment following the application of neoliberal reform. Such ill effects have ushered in a strong anti-neoliberal current that has opened up new spaces for discussion and debate about alternative development models for the region. Perhaps the most radical alternative to emerge is the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA). ALBA’s architects have been explicit in their denunciation of neoliberalism and insist that ALBA is an alternative that has been designed to rectify the ills associated with neoliberal reform. The following analysis examines ALBA as an alternative idea and practice of development. The following analysis examines the ways in which ALBA is formulated as an abstract alternative to neoliberalism and highlights the concrete policies and projects that distinguish it from the defining aspects of the neoliberal model.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Why Females Fight: Predicting Political Activism among Palestinian Female Youth</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Spellings, Carolyn Reagh</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A distinct focus on female youth experiences in political contests has been lacking in the literature on youth and political violence despite many female youth’s involvement with armed groups. The first Palestinian Intifada (1987-1993) saw the participation of many female youth alongside both teenage boys and men. This is notable especially given the patriarchal culture of Palestinian society in that women and young girls are traditionally confined to the private sphere. Additionally, public interactions with men and young boys could be viewed as improper and threats to one’s honor and purity may ensue. In light of these facts, the purpose of this study is to investigate the experience of Palestinian female adolescents in zones of political conflict - specifically in the Gaza Strip during the First Intifada. More specifically, this study explores the relationship between socioeconomic status, religious, political and individual characteristics on differences in levels of female participation and activist behaviors. Data were collected via self-report survey in the Gaza Strip in 1998 from a sample of 960 youth, 375 of which were female. Models predicting political involvement are assessed through hierarchical linear regression analyses. Results indicated that socioeconomic status, age, efficacy, religiosity, and political affiliation predicted Palestinian female youth activism in the first Intifada. No interaction was found between religiosity, political affiliation, and activism. These findings are discussed in relation to the broader literature on civic and political engagement of youth as well as gender issues in orthodox Islamic societies.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>From Hyperspace to Mental Hygiene: A. T. Schofield’s Conception of Mind and Spirit</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Fromke, Kara L.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper explores the intersection of psychology and religion in late-Victorian Britain through the life of medical psychologist and lay religious author, Dr. Alfred Taylor Schofield. Extending the work of recent scholarship on the contested nature of nineteenth-century sciences of mind, this study focuses on the interplay between popular and professional communities engaged in discourse over mind/body issues and the unconscious mind, and the relevance of these contemporary topics to debates over the certainty of natural versus supernatural knowledge.
In the period between 1890 and 1910, when psychology (‘the new psycho-physiology,’ in Britain) emerged as an autonomous scientific discipline separate from its past disciplinary home within moral philosophy, the application of psychology within medicine (early psychiatry) encountered institutional and philosophical impediments that hindered the incorporation of psychodynamic theories and new psychotherapeutic regimens into medical curriculum and clinical practice. This paper examines the rising cultural phenomena of faith healing, the responses of religious and medical communities to popular healing movements, and the implications that these movements had for both the development of early psychiatry as well as for contemporary transformations in religious sensibilities.
Utilizing the unique position of A.T. Schofield, who straddled a popular-professional divide in mediating between medical and lay religious communities, this paper seeks to explain how the proliferation of popular healing movements provoked professional interest in new psychotherapies while psycho-physiological explanations of faith healing altered lay religious understandings of ‘miracles’ and transcendental knowledge.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Study of Crack Closure Phenomenon Following One Tensile Overload</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sun, Yinan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>During the load-controlled high-cycle fatigue test, when the overload was applied, it is shown that from the crack-growth rate (da/dN) versus stress-intensity-factor range (K) curve, the crack-growth rate decreased, following the overload, which indicated the crack-closure phenomenon. The crack-growth-retardation period was observed after the overload. The goal of this study is to investigate the deformation evolution during tensile loading and unloading cycles using neutron diffraction.
Neutron diffraction is used to investigate the crack-closure phenomenon by measuring the changes in the elastic-lattice-strain profiles around the fatigue-crack tip in a compact-tension (CT) specimen during tensile loading and unloading cycles. Spatially-resolved-strain measurements were performed to determine the in-plane and through-thickness lattice-strain profiles ahead of the crack tip under a constant tensile load. The strain scanning was repeated under various applied loads ranging from 667 to 6,667 N. Subsequently, an overload at 8,889N was applied. The strain scans repeated. After the overload, large compressive strain fields were observed close to the crack tip, indicative of the crack-closure phenomena.
Residual strain/stress mapping using neutron diffraction was also designed to investigate the mechanism of the retardation phenomenon by mapping the changes in the lattice-strain profiles around the fatigue-crack tip in a series of compact-tension (CT) specimens, which were fatigued to various stages through the retardation period after the overload. Following the overload, compressive-strain fields were observed along the loading direction close to the crack tip. As the crack grows out of the retardation period, the residual compressive strains decreased. The results provide a microscopic understanding of the overload effect during cyclic loading.
The plastic deformation ahead of a fatigue-crack tip was measured from the diffraction-peak-width changes. The dislocation density was estimated from the fullwidth- half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peaks. High dislocation densities around the crack tip were observed after the overload. Furthermore, the plastic-zone size in front of the crack tip was estimated from the diffraction-peak broadening, which showed a good agreement with the calculated result. The plasticity-induced crack-closure phenomenon after an overload was observed.
The measured elastic strains and dislocation densities will be compared to the finite-element simulations that are based on an irreversible, hysteretic-cohesive interface model. The experimental and numerical results will be compared and discussed.
The deformation in the vicinity of the crack tip was not only studied with the neutron diffraction, but also the x-ray microbeam diffraction. The results help understand the overload effect, which induced a large plastic deformation causing dislocations inhomogeneously arranged around the crack tip. From neutron-diffraction measurements, the anisotropic line broadening was observed in front of the crack tip. Furthermore, Laue patterns, obtained from the microbeam diffraction at different locations near the crack, provide a better spatial resolution and show alternating regions with high and low dislocation densities. Overall, the dislocation density was found to decrease with the distance from the crack tip.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Die Zukunft gehoert dem Ingeniuer: Herman Soergel's Attempt to Engineer Europe's Salvation</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Linger, Ryan Bartlett</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Herman Sörgel devised a plan, beginning in 1927, to usher in a new era of peace and prosperity for the whole of Europe.  Atlantropa was his answer to the perceived threats that the European people faced from international competition, overpopulation, and lack of resources.  The plan would have resulted in the lowering of the Mediterranean Sea and the ultimate creation of one continent comprised of the former Europe and Africa.  Though the plan was never implemented, it poses a fascinating model through which historians may reconsider the time period between the end of the First and Second World Wars.
This thesis examines some historical socio-political movements through the lens of Sörgel’s megaproject.  Original publications from Herman Sörgel himself as well as those of two notable Atlantropa scholars, Alexander Gall and Wolfgang Voigt, explain in great detail the technical and sociological aspects of the plan.  Additionally, theories from Jeffrey Herf, Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, and Dina Brandt aid in the understanding of the man who attempted to engineer Europe out of crisis.   The following analysis reveals the difficulty in placing Herman Sörgel into any singular political or social movement in his time.  Though he espoused some of the same rhetoric as that of the National Socialists and pan-European movements alike, he failed to conform to any particular group.  The unwavering obsession with his project consumed all of Sörgel’s energies until his death in 1952.  Though all-but-forgotten, the project offers an uncommon means by which to view a tumultuous time in Europe.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>“Because It Happened Here”: Holocaust Education in Contemporary Poland</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Crabtree, April Marie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Each year, we move away from the Holocaust as active history. On each subsequent anniversary, we carefully repackage this atrocity in history with claims of ‘never again’ or ‘remember.’ The focus on this past should be crucial to our actions in the present and important to our future. One of the biggest questions asked has been ‘what have we learned?’
As students today grow further and further away from the Holocaust era, it remains to be seen if these lessons in humanity and inhumanity will simply fade away. With the danger of the Holocaust falling solely into history textbooks, Poland has instituted compulsory Holocaust Education to promote the teaching of this material. Yet, the lessons from this period in history extend beyond a glance into the past into an understanding of changing human obligations. The hope is that Poland’s efforts in Holocaust Education will build upon values and ideas that seek to integrate human beings on similar, simpler levels. Ultimately, the goal of Holocaust Education is not to teach about the period of history from 1933 to 1945. The aim is to instruct and critically examine the implications of hate and intolerance.
Based on fieldwork in Poland, this research explores the current teaching strategies and attitudes toward Holocaust Education. This thesis will discuss aspects of the educational evolution of Holocaust Education with a special emphasis on how teachers are teaching the subject. Using a survey of 155 Polish teachers, this project looks at what teachers are teaching about the Holocaust, what they hope students gain from learning about the subject, and why they teach it.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Neuroticism, Marital Violence, and the Moderating Role of Stress and Behavioral Skills</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hellmuth, Julianne C</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Do high levels of neuroticism predict intimate partner violence (IPV)? Although neuroticism may predispose partners to increased risks of IPV perpetration, the extent to which it predicts such perpetration is likely to depend on the broader context of the relationship. Consistent with this prediction, the current longitudinal study of 169 community couples revealed that the effects of neuroticism on IPV perpetration over the first four years of marriage were moderated by observations of problem-solving behavior and objective ratings of chronic stress. Specifically, although husbands and wives who scored higher on a measure of neuroticism at the outset of marriage engaged in more IPV throughout the marriage on average, those who possessed more effective problem-solving skills or experienced lower levels of stress were significantly less like to engage in IPV. Results highlight the importance of considering the broader relationship context when examining predictors of specific interpersonal processes.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Universal Voltage Rate Sensor Interface</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kruttiventi, Jayanth Chakradhar</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Measurement of heat flux is required in many aerospace and heat treatment applications. Temperature data collected at embedded sites are noisy especially when measurements are taken in hostile environments. The predicted heat flux, when based on the rate of change of temperature, is more accurate than using temperature data as the latter data form is ill-posed. In the context of heat flux prediction, calculating the rate of change of temperature involves differentiation, which is the primary source of ill-posed effects.
This work involves developing a universal voltage rate sensor interface that minimizes these effects and also improves the signal-to-noise ratio. This is based on the concept of amplitude modulating the temperature data and differentiating it at a higher frequency. The proposed concept of improvement in signal-to-noise ratio was verified by the Matlab and PSpice simulations. The experimental outputs matched the simulations results.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Impact of Larger Diameter Strands on AASHTO/PCI Bulb-Tees</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Vadivelu, Jayaprakash</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis consists of the analytical study and the experimental investigation of larger diameter strands in AASHTO Type I girders. The main purpose of this study was to verify that the 2 inch minimum spacing recommended by ACI 318-08 and AASHTO (2008) can be used for 0.7 inch diameter strands by comparing various effects in girders using 0.7 and 0.6 inch diameter strands. Based on the parametric analysis it was concluded that by using 0.7 inch strands there was a considerable saving in the material. For example, an AASHTO BT-72 with 0.6 inch strand could be replaced with AASHTO BT-54 with 0.7 inch strand for the same span capacity. In order to fully realize the benefits and to verify the adequacy of 2 inch spacing, a three dimensional finite element analysis was performed with two full-scale AASHTO Type I girders with 0.6 inch and 0.7 inch diameter strands. Only the effects due to the prestressing force at transfer were studied in the two models. The maximum principal stress and the axial stress in the concrete along the direction of the strands were determined. Based on the analytical results from the FE model it was found that the girder with the 0.7 inch diameter strand was more vulnerable to cracking at the transition zone between the bottom flange and the web. This defect could be overcome by placing the required amount of confinement reinforcement at the end zone of the girder. Based on the analytical study, two I-girder specimens, one with larger 0.7 in. strand and other with high strength 0.62 in. strand were cast. The transfer lengths of both the girders were measured and compared with the current AASHTO 2008 and ACI 318-08 equations. It was found that both strands exhibited a shorter transfer length than obtained in the equations. Based on these experimental results further studies are to be carried out for the implementation of these highly efficient strands.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Career Satisfaction of Sales Professionals: The Role of Personality</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Foster, Nancy A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>According to P-E fit theory from a vocational psychology perspective (see Holland, 1985), individuals differ in their attitudes, values, beliefs and behaviors, which in turn affect their career choices and their satisfaction with those choices. These differences, collectively termed &quot;personality,&quot; influence both work and life outcomes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between personality traits and career satisfaction in a sample of sales professionals. An archival dataset was examined that included the &quot;Big Five&quot; and other work-related, narrow personality traits, as well as career satisfaction variables. All traits were significantly and positively related to career satisfaction except for Image Management, which was significantly, but negatively related to career satisfaction. The highest correlations were found between the measure of career satisfaction and emotional stability, optimism, and work drive. Implications for career planning and development, and personnel recruitment, selection, and training are discussed, along with future research recommendations.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Modification of Nancie Atwell's Reading Workshop for Implementation in a Homogeneous Group of Struggling Adolescent Readers</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Pickett, Marilyn Ludwig</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this qualitative study was to determine the effectiveness of Nancie Atwell's reading workshop in motivating homogeneously grouped, struggling adolescent readers in a public school setting. This naturalistic, personal narrative describes the Atwell workshop and the modifications made to it for implementation with this group of students. Atwell, a noted reading educator, uses specific strategies to teach the heterogeneously grouped students in her private school in Maine. Her students' independent thinking skills and personal connections to text are remarkable.  Since I do not teach in the same environment as Atwell, I modified Atwell's strategies to meet the needs of my students and to teach Tennessee State Standards. I questioned whether this modified workshop approach would engage my students in reading and develop independent thinking skills.  Data collected during normal classroom instruction included: teacher observation; student and parent comments (both written and verbal); students‟ written responses on literary letters; shared connections during book talks; and demonstrated critical thinking during class discussions. These data proved the success of the modified workshop.  Additionally, recommendations are included to continue and further modify the reading workshop for the next school year. Future data collected will reveal the benefit of students participating in the workshop for two consecutive years.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Study of Interaction Between Mexican Free-tailed Bats (Tadarida Brasiliensis) and Moths and Counting Moths in a Real Time Video</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kolli, Haritha</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Brazilian free tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) are among the most abundant and widely distributed species in the southwestern United States in the summer. Because of their high metabolic needs and diverse diets, bats can impact the communities in which they live in a variety of important ways. The role of bats in pollination, seed dispersal and insect control has been proven to be extremely significant. Due to human ignorance, habitat destruction, fear and low reproductive rates of bats, there is a decline in bat populations. T.brasiliensis eats large quantities of insects but is not always successful in prey capture. In the face of unfavorable foraging condition bats reduce energy expenditure by roosting. By studying the interaction between bats and adults insects along with the associated energetics, we estimate the pest control provided by bats in agro-ecosystems to help understand their ecological importance. To visualize the interaction between bats and adult insects, a simulator has been designed. This simulator is based upon an individual based modeling approach. Using the simulator, we investigated the effect of insect densities and their escape response on the foraging pattern of bats.
Traditionally synthetic pesticides were used to control pest population. But recently the use of transgenic crops has become widespread because of the benefits such as fewer pesticide applications and increased yield for growers. To study the effect of these transgenic crops on moth densities and subsequently on bats foraging activity, videos were recorded in the fields at Texas. To count the moths in the videos, we utilized image segmentation techniques such as thresholding and connected component labeling. Accuracy up to 90% has been achieved using these techniques.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Applying Human Factors Principles In Aviation Displays: A Transition From Analog to Digital Cockpit Displays In The CP140 Aurora Aircraft</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Palmer, Ryan C.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A flight test program that evaluated the results of a CP140 Aurora cockpit modernization project was conducted between May 2004 and October 2005. This paper uses the results of that test program to show how basic human factors principles were violated which led to the identification of multiple design deficiencies. This paper proposes that the failure to apply good human factors principles when designing aircraft displays can lead to unacceptable deficiencies. The result can be poor modal awareness, confusion in the cockpit, and often negative training for the pilots. In particular, four major deficiencies were analyzed to determine the specific human factors principles that were breached. The violations included a lack of concise and relevant feedback to the pilot, unclear and ambiguous annunciations, poor use of colour coding principles and logic, a lack of suitable attention capture cueing, inappropriate alert cueing, an absence of aural cueing during specific degraded modes of operation, excessive cognitive workload, and a failure to incorporate the pilot as the focal point of the display design, also known as a human centred design philosophy. Recommendations for system design enhancements are provided to ensure safe and effective operations of this prototype system prior to operational implementation.
The evaluation of the prototype system design was conducted by a flight test team from the Aerospace Engineering Test Establishment in Cold Lake, Alberta and supported by the Maritime Proving and Evaluation Unit in Greenwood, Nova Scotia. The test program encompassed a thorough review of system design documentation, abinitio training and preliminary testing in a Systems Integration Lab and 40 flight test missions. The recorded deficiencies were based upon the observations of two Qualified Test Pilots.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Subjective Social Status and Youth’s Body Mass Index and Perceived Weight</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Phagan, Jennifer Renee</dc:creator>
<dc:description>To date there are no studies focusing on the relationship between subjective social status (SSS) and weight perceptions among young people.  This study aims to fill this gap in current available literature by examining associations between youth’s family SSS and individual SSS with their gender, race, body mass index (BMI), and weight perceptions.  Questionnaires and BMI data were collected from 1,171 youth participating in the 2008 Global Finals of Destination ImagiNation (DI) hosted by the University of Tennessee.  Participants ranged in ages 11 to 18 years.  Regression analyses indicated that gender, race and individual SSS were significant predictors of BMI.  Gender was the only significant predictor of underweight perceptions, while gender, race, and individual SSS were predictors of overweight perceptions.  Results for outcomes based on two grade levels, middle school and high school, are also discussed.  Findings have implications of gender and racial differences for BMI and weight perception status.  Lastly, individual SSS within the school community was a significant predictor of both BMI and overweight perception.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>How Textbooks Influence Students’ Algebra Learning: A Comparative Study on the initial treatment of the concept of function</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hu, Qintong</dc:creator>
<dc:description>To give insights into cross national differences in schooling this study analyzed the initial treatment of the concept of function in three curricula: a US standards-based text--Connected Mathematic 2: Variables and Patterns, a US conventional text--Glencoe: Mathematics Applications and Concepts: Course 2, and a Chinese reform text--Shu Xue: Grade 8, first volume. 
This study examined content organization and problem features in the three textbooks. For content analysis, this study explored how the concept of function was introduced, defined, and developed. The results indicated both of the US textbooks introduce this concept at grade 7 whereas the Chinese text does so at grade 8. Connected Mathematics devotes more lessons than the Chinese text and Glencoe in the initial treatment of the concept of function. Connected Mathematics defines function as rule while Glencoe addresses it as relationship; the Chinese text introduces the concept of function as correspondence. Connected Mathematics pays equal an amount of attention to the four representations including tables, graphs, verbal descriptions, and equations examined in this study. In contrast, Glencoe employs the representations of tables, graphs, and equations and it focuses on the representation of graphs; the Chinese text also employs the representations of tables, graphs, and equations but it focuses on the representation of equation. The Chinese text provides many explanations and illuminations in worked-out examples to tell how the solutions are derived. 
Problems were then analyzed extensively with respect to three criteria: (1) contextual feature, (2) response type, and (3) cognitive expectation. Analysis results showed that all the three texts emphasize the cognitive expectation of representation. Connected Mathematics provides more real-world problems than other texts; and the problems aim at cultivating students’ mathematical reasoning. Most of the problems in Glencoe are embedded in pure math contexts to help students do procedure practice. The problems in the Chinese text emphasize problem solving. Implications for curriculum developers, teachers, and researchers have been discussed in accordance with the findings.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Modeling of Unreinforced Construction Joints in Plain Concrete Using GT STRUDL</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Carroll, James Christopher</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to develop a method to predict the behavior of unreinforced concrete construction joints using the computer program GT STRUDL. Two three-dimensional finite element models of a navigation lock wall were constructed. The wall was subjected to eccentric prestress forces, which brought about concern for lift-off within the lock wall.
Eleven loading combinations were evaluated, which were created from seven independent loading conditions. Stresses for each loading combination were compared to nominal strength values as detennined by ACI 318-02, Chapter 22, for plain concrete. Results show the stresses to be acceptable throughout the wall and displacements to be negligible; thus, the structural integrity of the lock wall is adequate for continued operation.
A detailed description of the study including the computer modeling, results, and recommendations are discussed in this thesis.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Synthesis and Crystal Chemistry of Ca12Al14O33 doped with Fe2O3</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ude, Sabina Nwamaka</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The crystal chemistry of Fe doped mayenite (Ca12Al14-xFexO33) samples prepared using solid state and sol-gel synthesis techniques were compared. Five samples were prepared using solid state process with varying Fe concentration (x) where x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25 and 0.3; two sets of samples were made via the sol-gel, the first set was prepared for studying the amount of Fe substituted by varying the Fe concentration where x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 and the second set was prepared for studying the firing temperature and did not contain Fe additions (x = 0). Samples produced via the sol-gel method were more likely to be single phase with incorporation of Fe2O3 while solid state samples contained multiple phases over the same range of Fe2O3 substitutions. The refined lattice parameters, of samples prepared using both methods were observed to increase with increasing Fe concentration, suggesting Fe is replacing Al since Fe has larger ionic radii than Al. Samples prepared via the sol-gel method were found to be single phase at lower temperatures compared to samples prepared via solid state synthesis. Samples synthesized using the sol-gel method were found to have multiple phases when fired at 800 ˚C but were single phase when fired at 900˚C. In comparison, samples synthesized using traditional solid state techniques showed single phase when fired at a temperature of 1350˚C.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Precision Farming Information Sources Used by Cotton Farmers</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Jenkins, Amanda Renee</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Precision farming entails production decisions that are made by obtaining data about soil and field traits. Information about yield and soil characteristics at different locations is collected and management strategies consistent with this information are designed. Information providers play a major role in helping farmers incorporate precision farming information into their decision-making processes. The main goal of this research is to add to the understanding of preferences of information sources in the context of precision farming. Data from cotton farmers in 11 Southeastern states were used to achieve this goal. Results from this study can be utilized by precision farming information providers to more effectively target their clientele.
This thesis examines two related research topics. The first essay focuses on the use of Extension as a source of precision farming information and the factors that determine preferences for this information source. The second essay examines farm business attributes, farmer characteristics and regional factors affecting cotton farmers‘ use of various precision farming information sources.
Farmers‘ preferences for precision farming education programming from Extension were described and analyzed using a basic statistical analysis. Results indicate that farmers tend to use various information sources simultaneously with Extension to make decisions about precision farming technology. An independent samples t-test showed that the means for age, education, income, farm size, and land tenure were statically significantly different between Extension users and non-users when other factors that may influence the use of precision farming information sources were not controlled.
A multivariate probit model was used in the second essay to determine the farm business, farmer, and regional characteristics affecting the use of different precision farming information sources. The multivariate approach accounts for correlation among the different information sources. Results suggest that the decision to use a precision farming information source may be correlated with the decision to use other information sources. When controlling for other factors that may influence the use of precision farming information sources age, education, farm size, and income were found to significantly affect the decision to use information sources.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Aperture and Temporality in Interior Space</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Cope, Heather Lee</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis is an investigation of interior space and its incorporation of the exterior environment. The cyclical changes of the exterior environment can be controlled within interior space, providing for the occupant temporal experiences of light, temperature, noise, and weather. By incorporating these cyclical changes, interior space is given life, providing a reference to experience a changing environment. This thesis will be explored at the frontier where interior and exterior environments meet through a study of external walls and aperture. The design project is a Roman Catholic Church. Catholic worship and church design incorporate water, light, and acoustics. This thesis will investigate the potential of aperture and temporality to emphasize the use of these elements and invigorate sacred space by engaging the exterior. The project is located at Meads Quarry in South Knoxville. The old marble quarry is a sequence of three distinct quarries. Each has its own unique characteristics of water, shade, and light providing opportunity to investigate interior space situated in particular exterior environments.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Characterizing Episodic Stream Acidity During Stormflow in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Deyton, Edwin Bradley</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Episodic stream acidification occurs as storm events temporarily reduce acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) and pH. Stream acidification is suspected to have damaging effects on the health of aquatic ecosystems and biota. The objectives of this research are to 1) characterize stream baseflow and stormflow chemistries in three watersheds in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM), 2) understand potential mechanisms responsible for episodic acidification, and 3) understand the relationship between storm event magnitude, antecedent soil moisture condition, and the stream’s pH response. Three remote, forested, high-elevation streams (Middle Prong, Ramsey Prong, and Eagle Rocks Prong) were selected in the Middle Prong of the Little Pigeon River Watershed. Multi-parameter data sondes were installed at each site to record continuous stream data. Autosamplers were set up in connection with the sondes to collect samples during storm events. Stormflow, baseflow, and precipitation samples were analyzed for pH, ANC, and a broad spectrum of cations and anions that contribute to the ion balance.
During stormflow, ANC and pH depressions were observed for all storms at each study site. Sulfate, nitrate, and organic acid concentrations increased during each storm. Base cation concentrations generally increased during stormflow at Middle and Ramsey Prongs, but diluted occasionally on Eagle Rocks Prong. The relative changes in ion concentrations were used to determine which ions (acids) were most responsible for ANC depression. ANC contribution analysis indicates acid deposition may be the primary cause of episodic acidification, but it appears organic acids and cation dilution may also contribute. Pyritic geology is also suspected to contribute to baseflow and stormflow acidity in the Eagle Rocks Prong. Data exploration indicates large storms preceded by long, dry periods cause the largest pH depressions. It appears stream acidification may be driven by acid deposition, but additional inputs from varying vegetation and geology create unique and complex response to the observed stream acidification.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Integrating and Applying Conservation Development Principles to Commercial Sites: A Business Park in Bristol, TN</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Chandler, Christopher Lee</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Abstract
Throughout history, land has been treated as man's platform for development and expansion into new territories and the basis for our current infrastructure. Understanding existing properties and characteristics of the land has become imperative to successful development and strong networks that connect human beings to one another. As we discover ever changing natural tendencies, we are prone to rethinking the way in which the land is engaged from a developmental and conservational standpoint. Coexisting with natural processes of the earth and the land is of utmost importance to the success of human systems using it as a base for growth.
Land is becoming very scarce as the human race expands its network, which makes the term &quot;Conservation Development&quot; an integral part of the future of infrastructure. Conservation Development is defined as the process of planning, designing, building, and managing communities that preserves landscapes or other community resources that are considered valuable for their aesthetic, environmental, cultural, agricultural, and/or historic values (McMahon, 2010). Critically analyzing potential sites prior to any ground work is vital to successful conservation development. Specifically, Bristol West is a challenging site and as with every site it has specific constraints and opportunities for development. If developed using traditional methods, it has the potential of being built upon without responding to the existing features and natural resources, which could potentially lead to economic and environmental problems. Some problems include wildlife corridor interruptions, flooding problems within the site and contextually, destruction of the character and &quot;sense of place&quot; of Bristol, unsuccessful business applications, and strip development.
The appropriateness of conservation development to a site in Bristol will be examined through analyzing existing topography, natural drainage patterns, wildlife corridors, and relationships to surrounding context. Strip development of the site could hinder the economic and environmental integrity of Bristol,  TN if certain issues are not addressed throughout its planning process. Therefore, more responsible development strategies are explored as well as how economically efficient the site can be for its surrounding context and the City of Bristol, Tennessee.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Characteristics of Underground Utility Repairs Made in Asphaltic Roadways – Comparing the Use of Grade D Aggregate as a Viable Backfill Option</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Deland, Susan Gail</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Abstract
Given that most utilities are located beneath public right of ways, it is difficult to perform repairs to the utility without significantly disturbing the existing roadway. Currently there are several standard orders of procedure that deal with small-scale repairs on asphaltic surfaces. This study investigates the use of Grade D Aggregate as a backfill during a utility repair versus the condition of the repair. Five East Tennessee utilities provided a total of 60 utility repair locations over three years of age; 30 of which incorporated Grade D Aggregate and 30 incorporated #57 Stone.
The Tennessee Department of Transportation specifies a smoothness criterion of the roadway to regulate any deviation of the surface of the roadway greater than ¼ inch over a 12-foot span. The parameters measured during this study include smoothness, condition of the asphalt topcoat, adjacent stress cracking, depth of repair and disturbed surface area. Multiple linear regression and analysis of variance tests were used to analyze the results.
Results suggest that there is no difference between using and not using Grade D Aggregate except with failures of one inch or greater. The results also suggest that there is little to no relationship between roadway characteristics and the performance of the repair except with failures one inch or greater. There is a correlation between slope and failures that had a deviation of one inch or greater. The results suggest that Grade D Aggregate performs better when significant failures occur. Recommendations include implementation of a cutback area, development and implementation of installation guidelines within the municipality, and implementation of a maintenance program that will address the repair cut failures in a timely manner.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Volunteer Management Needs Assessment of the Tennessee 4-H Program</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Casteel, Robbie B</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this descriptive study was to conduct a state-wide needs assessment of Tennessee 4-H Youth Development Extension Agents to determine the perception in working with 4-H Volunteer Leaders and the knowledge level of volunteer management.  This study also determined the need for a formalized 4-H Volunteer Leader management system.  Targeted participants were University of Tennessee (UT) Extension Agents and Tennessee State University (TSU) Extension Agents with 4-H job responsibility.  Participants were asked to complete a four part questionnaire instrument.  Components one through three of the instrument were used to determine the need for a formalized 4-H Volunteer Leader management system, the knowledge level in managing and the perception of working with 4-H Volunteer Leaders.  The final component was used to collect demographic information. 	After completion of a pilot study, 161 Extension Agents were targeted to participate in the study.  The questionnaire was administered on web-based data collection system known as Survey Monkey.  Results indicated 90% of Extension Agents agreed there is a need for readily available, web-based materials.  Results also indicated a need (66% agreeing) for a comprehensive 4-H Volunteer Leader management system.  Also, results found high proficiencies, up to 97%, in both knowledge levels of managing 4-H Volunteer Leaders and perceptions of working with 4-H Volunteer Leaders.  Demographic information was correlated among measures of knowledge, perception and the need for a formalized 4-H Volunteer Leader management system.  Significant correlations were found between risk management of 4-H Volunteer Leaders and Extension tenure, also between Extension tenure and the perception of 4-H Volunteer Leaders being welcome within the school system.  Significant correlations were also between recruiting volunteers and outside of Extension volunteer/employee management; between outside of Extension volunteer/employee management and removing 4-H Volunteer Leaders.  Implications indicate a need for additional resources to provide training and information for both agents and 4-H Volunteer Leaders.  Findings also indicate materials should be web-based for easy access for both agent and 4-H Volunteer Leader use.  Data responses show there is a need for a formalized 4-H Volunteer Leader management system that would encompass all aspects from recruitment to retention of 4-H Volunteer Leaders.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Newspaper Coverage of the South Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement: A Framing Analysis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Park, Yeonah</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study compared how four English-language newspapers in the United States and South Korea covered the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA). A content analysis using QDA Miner was conducted for 354 articles from the New York Time, the Washington Post, the Korea Herald, and the Korea Times to determine how each paper framed the topic. Overall the newspapers’ media framing aligned with their national concerns and interests.
The literature review supported the idea that identifying frames in natural language articles and investigating the relative highlighting of issues was important in analyzing news coverage. The two Korean newspapers gave the issue of the KORUS FTA four times more news coverage than the two U.S. papers. The Korean public showed their concerns by rallies against the KORUS FTA during the negotiations. Opinion pieces of the U.S. newspapers gave their audiences generalized information on this issue while opinion stories of Korean papers focused on for-or-against debates about the KORUS FTA. The U.S. and Korean newspapers covered various industries differently reflecting the relative importance of those industries to each country if the treaty were approved eventually by the U.S. Congress and the Korean National Assembly. In addition, this research found that news stories in papers from both nations followed episodic frames, whereas opinion articles used thematic frames.
This study provided empirical evidence to contribute to journalism scholars, journalists, and audiences for a better understanding of media framing.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Tectonics of the Northeastern Inner Piedmont, Northwestern NC, from Detailed Geologic Mapping, Geochronologic, Geochemical, and Petrologic Studies with Structural Analyses of Ductile Fault Zones</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Gatewood, Matthew Patrick</dc:creator>
<dc:description>New field and laboratory data collected for the northeastern Inner Piedmont (IP) reveal the structure and composition of a portion of the southern Appalachian crystalline core, delimited the timing of orogenesis, and provide new insight into the nature of deep crustal processes during orogenesis. Previously recognized lithologies are continuous throughout the study area and comprise two distinct crystalline thrust sheets: the Marion and Brindle Creek thrust sheets, or eastern Tugaloo and western Cat Square terranes, respectively. Western IP Precambrian- Cambrian(?) metasedimentary lithologies and Ordovician metaigneous lithologies make up the Marion thrust sheet northwest of a Neoacadian suture, the Brindle Creek fault zone (BCFZ). To the southeast, the Brindle Creek thrust sheet contains Siluro-Devonian metasedimentary lithologies, which were intruded by Devonian anatectic metaigneous units.
Rocks in the study area preserve a polyphase thermal, metamorphic, and deformational history. Textural evidence suggests that two high-temperature events, followed by a retrograde event affected these lithologies. Peak metamorphic conditions of 745°C and 7.1 kbar are estimated for eastern IP assemblages using garnet core compositional data. Garnet rim compositional data indicate a clockwise P-T path for eastern IP lithologies. This is supported by textural observations of sillimanite replacing kyanite, further suggesting prograde conditions during metamorphism.
Northeastern IP lithologies retain evidence of six deformation events. The Mill Spring fault zone is recognized as a late dextral strike-slip fault that splayed from the Alleghanian Brevard fault zone. Map and outcrop-scale truncations of structures and lithologies of known ages provide relative and absolute timing constraints for IP orogenic pulses. Western IP D1 structures were produced by a pre-Neoacadian event, likely related to the 480-460 Ma Taconic orogeny. Eastern IP D1 structures are the product of initial subduction of Cat Square terrane lithologies beneath the Carolina terrane before BCFZ emplacement. D2 and D3 are responsible for regional structural trends, developed during the Neoacadian orogeny. SWvergent D4 dextral shear fabrics are related to dextral movement along the Alleghanian Brevard fault zone. Subsequent deformation features are brittle and result from Alleghanian uplift, and Mesozoic and Cenozoic extensional and rifting events.
The presence of two ductile fault zones in the study area, the Tumblebug Creek fault zone (TCFZ) and the BCFZ, provides a unique opportunity to study the development of two crustal-scale structures in an orogenic core. Here, the relationships between mineral reactions, deformation mechanisms, fluid flow, volume loss, and mylonitization are investigated for two granitic mylonites. Fluid flow paths are interpreted from SW-trending regional linear fabrics. Shear zone formation is characterized by the breakdown of quartz and feldspar, coeval with the formation of myrmekite and biotite. Crystal-plastic mechanisms operating at temperatures &gt;400°C were responsible for the deformation during shear-zone development. Silica and alkalis were lost during deformation, while immobile major and trace element concentrations remained constant. Volume losses of 41 and 48% occurred for the TCFZ and BCFZ, respectively.
Zircon geochronologic data for northeastern IP lithologies provide new limits on the timing of orogenesis in the IP, and have produced a new developmental model for the Paleozoic development of the southern Appalachian crystalline core. Western IP Ordovician granitoids record the development of a volcanic arc system off of the Laurentian margin ~490 Ma. Taconic (480-460 Ma) arc accretion affected western IP lithologies, causing deformation, metamorphism, and magmatism. Eastern IP detrital zircon data indicate that the Cat Square terrane was being deposited after 430 Ma. Initial subduction of Cat Square sediments by the Carolina superterrane began by ~415 Ma. The Cat Square and Carolina terranes were accreted to the Laurentian margin together during the 360-340 Ma Neoacadian orogeny, causing the first shared thermal events between eastern and western IP terranes. Penetrative structures and dominant IP fabrics were developed during this event. Subsequent deformation occurred during dextral strike-slip motion along the Alleghanian Brevard fault zone.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Thermal Feasibility Study and Design of an Air-cooled Rectangular Wide Band Gap Inverter</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Faulkner, Jacob Christopher</dc:creator>
<dc:description>All power electronics consist of solid state devices that generate heat.  Managing the temperature of these devices is critical to their performance and reliability.  Traditional methods involving liquid-cooling systems are expensive and require additional equipment for operation.  Air-cooling systems are less expensive but are typically less effective at cooling the electronic devices.  The cooling system that is used depends on the specific application.
Until recently, silicon based devices have been used for the solid-state devices in power electronics.  Newly developed silicon-carbide based wide band gap devices operate at maximum temperatures higher than traditional silicon devices.  Due to the permissible increase in operating temperatures, it has been proposed to develop an air-cooling system for an inverter consisting of silicon carbide devices.
This thesis presents recent research efforts to develop the proposed air-cooling system.  The thermal performance of the each design iteration was determined by numerical simulations via the finite element method in both steady state and transient mode using COMSOL Multi-physics software version 3.5a.  For all simulations presented in this thesis, the heat dissipated in the MOSFETS and diodes are specified as functions of current, voltage, switching frequency, and junction temperature.  For both the steady state and transient simulations, the junction temperature was determined iteratively.  Additionally in the transient simulations, the current distribution is a function of time and was deduced from the EPA US06 drive cycle.  After several design iterations, a thermally feasible design has been reached.  This design is presented in detail in this thesis.
Under transient simulations of the final design, the maximum junction temperatures were determined to be below 146 ºC for air flow rates of 30 and 60 CFM, which is substantially lower than the 250 ºC maximum allowable junction temperature of Si-C devices.  However for steady state simulations, junction temperatures were found to be much higher than the transient simulations.  It was determined that a minimum flow rate of 50 CFM is required to meet the temperature requirements of the Si-C devices under steady state operating conditions.  The power density of this air-cooled final design is 11.75 kW/L, and it is competitive with liquid-cooled systems.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>POPULATION ABUNDANCE AND GENETIC STRUCTURE OF BLACK BEARS IN COASTAL SOUTH CAROLINA</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Drewry, John Michael</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Because of increasing frequency of bear sightings, vehicle collisions, and nuisance incidents in coastal South Carolina, the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources is developing a comprehensive black bear management plan.  However, no reliable estimates of population abundance or density are available.  I used genotypes of black bears determined from hair samples collected in Lewis Ocean Bay and Carvers Bay to estimate population abundance and density.  I obtained hair samples from snares during 8 weekly sampling periods in 2008 and 2009.  I used Huggins closed population models to estimate abundance and spatially explicit capture- recapture models to estimate density.  Based on model averaging, black bear abundance was 30 (SE = 9.3) on Carvers Bay and 42 (SE = 5.4) on Lewis Ocean Bay.  Model-averaged density was 0.037 bears/km2 (SE = 0.003) for Carvers Bay.  For Lewis Ocean Bay, population densities were much higher:  0.307 bears/km2 (SE = 0.025).  I extrapolated the density estimates to the upper coastal region of South Carolina, using logistic regression to weight density based on similarity of the regional landscape with the 2 study areas.  Predicted bear densities were low throughout the coastal region but several areas centered on more productive habitats (e.g., Carolina Bays, pocosin) and public lands (e.g., Francis Marion National Forest, Lewis Ocean Bay) had high densities.  I also sampled an area in North Carolina and assessed genetic structure among the 3 areas.  Based on heterozygosity, genetic distance, and genetic assignment, I found no evidence of historic or recent barriers to gene exchange among the 3 sampled populations.  However, demographic connectivity may be a concern for areas such as Lewis Ocean Bay, which is surrounded by highways and development.  If the goal is to maintain current black bear densities in those areas, maintaining connectivity with other habitat areas and mitigating impacts of highways would be important.  The regional map of potential black bear density may be useful to identify areas that should be surveyed for occupancy or where additional studies may be conducted (e.g., Francis Marion National Forest).</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Elastic and Magnetic Properties of Tb6Fe(Sb,Bi)2 Using Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy.</dc:title>
<dc:creator>McCarthy, David Michael</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Tb6FeSb2 and Tb6FeBi2 are novel rare earth compounds with little prior research. These compounds show high and variable curie temperatures for rare-earth compounds. This has lead to a literature review which includes the discussion of: elasticity, resonance, and magnetism. This review is used to discuss the theory and methodology which can relate these various properties to each other. Furthermore, synthesis, x-ray analysis, and RUS sample preparation of Tb6FeSb2 and Tb6FeBi2 were completed.
Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS) elastic studies were taken for Tb6FeSb2 and Tb6FeBi2 as a function temperature from 5-300K, in various magnetic fields ranging from 0-9T. Tb6FeSb2’s and Tb6FeBi2’s elastic moduli are related to their magnetic properties. Magnetization data, primarily M v. H, provides another measure the magnetic properties are used to help correlate the data to elasticity.
Tb6FeSb2 and Tb6FeBi2 Curie temperatures are 253(3)K and 246(5)K respectively. The low temperature magnetic transition of Tb6FeSb2 is 65-90K and Tb6FeBi2 is 55-75K. RUS suggests that this low temperature transition is somehow related to a structural transition but this transition does not occur in these two compounds. Co-substitution of Tb6FeSb2 and Tb6FeBi2 seem to greatly affect this lower temperature transition in RUS. It does not greatly effect the curie temperature. Low temperature XRD shows that Co-substitution also creates a structural transition in this family of compounds.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Antimicrobial Activity of Casein Hydrolysates against Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157:H7</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Christman, Jessica M</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Listeriosis has the highest fatality and hospitalization rate among foodborne illnesses. Listeria monocytogenes causes listeriosis and is a difficult bacterium for ready-to-eat food processors to eliminate because of its ability to grow in the absence of oxygen and under refrigeration. Recently, milk and its proteins have gained recognition as the largest source of biologically active peptides, and, it stands reason that several antimicrobial peptides (AMP) can be released from casein as it is the most abundant milk protein. AMPs are commonly obtained by cutting the whole protein into peptide fragments using enzymes or by acidification. The objective of this study was to predict potential AMPs through computer aided tools, improve hydrolysate preparation, and determine trypsin and pepsin-casein hydrolysate antimicrobial activity in growth media and on frankfurters against two strains of Listeria monocytogenes (Scott A and 310) and Escherichia coli O157:H7 (Salami strain).
The prediction study procedure was to identify the most common variants of primary peptide sequences. The sequences were analyzed for greatest possible enzyme cuts on the protein, peptide masses, isoelectric point, net charge and percent hydrophilic residues using online proteomics programs. The fragments were explored for AMP commonalities: fragment length of 3 to 50 amino acids, positive (cationic) net charge, and hydrophilic residues between 25 and 50%. This technique identified 16 potential AMPs which proved that it is possible to screen for AMPs.
The method used to determine the trypsin-casein hydrolysate (TCH) and pepsin-casein hydrolysate (PCH) antimicrobial activity was to hydrolyze sodium caseinate with pepsin or trypsin. L. monocytogenes (strains Scott A and 310) were incubated in 0, 10, 20, and 40% PCH and 0 and 50% TCH concentrations over a 24 hour period. PCH suppressed growth of L. monocytogenes Scott A by 1.76 log CFU/mL and reduced initial populations of L. monocytogenes 310 and E. coli O157:H7 by 0.52 and 0.62 log CFU/ml, respectively. TCH had little or no effect on growth suppression of any of the three test organisms.
The frankfurter study was conducted by spot inoculating frankfurters with L. monocytogenes Scott A and then dipping frankfurters into one of five treatments (deionized water, pH 2.7 buffer, pH 5.1 buffer, pH 2.7 PCH, and pH 5.1 PCH) for 30 seconds; inoculated frankfurters that were not dipped served as controls. Frankfurters were incubated at 32°C for seven days. The results showed that there was no significant difference (p&gt;0.05) in antimicrobial effectiveness among the treatments and control.
This study demonstrated that enzymatically derived casein hydrolysates somewhat inhibit growth of L. monocytogenes and E. coli O157:H7 in culture media, but were ineffective when applied to frankfurters. Casein hydrolysate solutions can be easily made in a processing facility for application in fluid systems such as an antimicrobial spray on beef carcasses and in milk, juice, sports drinks, soda, soups, and yogurt. It also could be used in solid systems such as frankfurters, cheese, ground beef, and processed or RTE foods.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Friendship in Die rote Zora und ihre Bande and Peter Pan</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Moldovi, Roswitha-Maria</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Children's books often show recurring themes. One such theme is friendship. My thesis is a comparatistic work between the German book Die rote Zora und ihre Bande by Kurt Held and the English book Peter Pan by J.M. Barrie, as those books have recently been turned into movies recently advertising the theme of friendship.  I compare these two books for parallel friendship constellations. This research reveals two types of friendships: cross-sex friendships and same-sex friendships. In both books cross-sex friendships can be seen within a group, 'Zoras Bande' and Wendy and the Lost Boys. I analyze these friendship constellations according to the features found in realistic friendships: companionship, reciprocity, acceptance, cultural background and other similarities.  Additionally, both books offer dyads (Zora-Branko, Zlata-Branko, Wendy-Peter) made up of a boy and a girl who stand out from the group. In comparing these dyads I use gender perception as a basis, for it reveals the similarities and differences within those dyads.  This research shows that that same-sex groups of friends' share other similarities than the cross-sex friendships. Both authors basically used these group constellations (―die Gymnasiasten‖, the pirates and the Indians) as a narrative device to propel the story. In my research I came to the results that even though both books seem to be similar at core due to the similar friendship constellations, there are nonetheless some differences. I trace these differences back to the different time periods the books were written and published in.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Utilizing an Ultrasonic Device to Model the Lumbar Spine While Driving a Tractor Trailer</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hinton, Gretchen Marie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Low back pain is a common occupational effect of the long term driving of vehicles. The sonoSens® Monitor ultrasonic device was utilized to model lumbar spinal motions while driving a tractor trailer. Further data was collected to determine if acceleration from a seat pad and EMG data correlated with the driver’s movements.
Three testing bouts were completed and analyzed for this study. For each test the driver drove a 1998 Peterbuilt 379 fitted with a National Seating 2000 seat. One driver was used for all three tests.
Data analysis was accomplished with the sonoSens® Analyzer and Microsoft® Excel software. The sonoSens® Analyzer software produced graphs of the spinal motion of the driver. These graphs were visually analyzed for motion trends and increased movement of the lumbar region.
The sonoSens® Monitor is ideal for determining motion and posture of the lumbar region over periods of time. Acceleration and EMG data was found not to correlate with a driver’s movements while driving.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Evaluation of a Chemical Fingerprinting Technique for Identifying the Sources of In-stream Sediments</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hull, Robert Alexander</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Sediment is often listed as one of the main contributors to the impairment of surface waters throughout the United States. Sediment source identification is difficult in watersheds with complex combinations of land-uses and non-point sources because of the complexities involved in correlating water quality data, which are relatively easy to collect, to the source of a degrading component. The elemental properties of a particular soil on the landscape may be viewed as a “fingerprint”. A comparison of the elemental fingerprints of potential sources and in-stream sediment may be used to establish sediment source. The objectives of this investigation were to characterize the elemental content of suspended stream sediment and potential sources of sediment in an impaired watershed, Pond Creek watershed in east Tennessee (HUC: TN06010201013), and to use multivariate statistical techniques to identify and quantify sediment sources in the watershed. Potential sediment source samples were collected throughout the watershed and suspended sediment samples at two locations. Subsamples of the &lt;53&gt;μm material and suspended sediment were subjected to total dissolution, HNO3-extraction, and Mehlich 3-extraction. Descriptive statistics suggested that each dataset contained considerable heterogeneity. The source samples were grouped according to land management and position in the landscape. The results of a Kruskal-Wallis rank test and discriminant function analysis indicated that for all three datasets the elemental variability of the samples was not sufficient to differentiate the source and sediment samples and characterize the suspended sediment sources using the initial group definitions. When using all available elemental data from each dataset the groups defined by cluster analysis and canonical discriminant analysis did not match the contents of the initially defined groups. The composition of the clusters varied from one dataset to another, making it difficult to draw conclusions concerning the cluster contents, or to identify sources of suspended sediment. The lack of elemental content variability for differentiating the source and sediment samples and characterizing the suspended sediment sources is likely an artifact of the watershed sampling procedure that was employed, which was directed towards sampling sources likely to be contributing to the suspended sediment load in Pond Creek.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Position of the Intellectual in the 1950s: Case Studies of J. D. Salinger and Ayn Rand</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bain, Stephen J</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose ofthis study was to examine the historical and social factors that influenced American intellectual life in the 1950s, and to apply these broader, cultural influences to case studies on two American writers working in the 1950s: J. D. Salinger and Ayn Rand. Research involved diverse readings in biography and literary criticism concerning the two authors as well as interpretation ofthe authors' works themselves.
Despite having opposing philosophical, aesthetic, and intellectual ideals, J. D. Salinger and Ayn Rand typify the position ofthe intellectual in the 1950s because they share the conflicting needs ofacceptance and superiority. While the two authors define intelligence in radically different ways, both attempt to escape the existential crisis of post-war life by offering solutions to the intellectuals' unique dilemma that emphasize intellectuals' roles as artists and economic producers.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Design of Equipment for the Study of Non-Isothermal Flow in Polymer Fluid</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kolawole, Opeoluwa Oluwaseun</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The polymer industry is an ever growing industry, and, as it grows, companies are continuously looking for ways to study and understand the behaviors of polymers in relation to the processing and production. This is to ensure the production of high quality products and to improve existing products.An important parameter during polymer processing is temperature. Temperature control affects several rheological parameters such as viscosity, and in turn the quality of the final products. Frictional or viscous heating is a very important part of polymer processing and occurs in almost every polymer processing operation.The objective of this research is to design the apparatus and setup the equipment to examine the validity of the Theory of Purely Entropic Elasticity (PPE) on non-isothermal flow of concentrated polymeric solutions under a wide range of shear rates. A basic rheological study of the polymer in use is performed. PEE once played an important role in polymer processing. PEE is the assumption that the internal energy of a polymeric material is solely dependent on temperature, and specifically is not dependent on the polymer deformation, as developed by Astarita and co-workers [1-3, 16].The design and results are presented. Potential improvements and future considerations are also presented.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Insight into the Gating Mechanism of Mechanosensitive Ion Channels using a simple structure: A step in the analysis of commotio cordis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kaul, Sumeet</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Mechanosensation in cells is a well known phenomenon that is associated with cellular responses to force. Our knowledge of the trigger mechanism of this phenomenon is, however, limited. Earlier studies in this field have used atomic simulations, which although being accurate, are limited in their feasibility in multi-length scenarios like a mechanosensitive channel that undergoes micro-level changes in the composition of the protein to cause a macro-level change in the state of a biological structure such as the muscle. Finite Element Analysis has been used in various engineering fields to study the mechanical response of complex structures. The current study is a step in utilizing the phenomenal capabilities of Finite Element Analysis in developing and studying a 3D model (Membrane-Channel) of a mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL). A simplified CAD structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TbMscL) was developed in the first stage of this study. The authenticity of this model was tested by applying two types of loading conditions, namely (i) In-plane stretch and (ii) Out-of-plane bending. The results obtained from the first step of analysis are in accordance with previous experimental data, which elucidates the fact that tension within the membrane guides the gating mechanism of the channel and not the curvature of the membrane. The second stage of the analysis involved the use of the same model to study the disease commotio cordis. This was achieved by calculating the loading conditions during the onset of the condition in the human heart and then transferring those conditions to the Membrane-Channel model developed in the first stage. The result showed that although the channel did not fully open but there was a significant change in the channel‟s radius that might cause the flow of ions, thereby changing the state of the channel. It is anticipated that this model will help future research in areas that conventionally have been difficult to model.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Life Cycle Comparison of Light-Frame Wood and Insulated Concrete Form Building Envelopes: Energy Use and Green House Gases</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Matthews, Sherman Authur</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Given the building sector’s substantial contribution to global energy use and green house gas (GHG) emissions, it is of great importance that only the most effective building envelopes are utilized. Conventional light-frame wood building envelopes are highly popular due to their ease of construction and building economy; however the life cycle performance of the building envelope is often overlooked when this selection is made. Although insulated concrete form (ICF) building envelopes generally require a substantially higher embodied energy input, it should be considered that improvements during a building’s operation phase can offers significant energy returns, ultimately reducing the building’s life cycle energy use and GHG intensity. Therefore, an assessment is conducted regarding the life cycle energy use and GHG intensity of the ICF building envelope, in addition to two light-frame wood building envelopes; the average light wood frame envelope (U.S. Department of Energy, 2007), and a more highly insulated wood frame envelope. The operation phase of the building envelopes proves to be of greatest significance, as it is attributed to 95- 97% of the total life cycle energy use, and 93-96% of life cycle GHG emissions, assuming a 100 year life cycle. Ultimately, the life cycle performance of the ICF building envelope is superior to the two wood frame envelopes due to its improvements in the operation phase. The ICF building envelope has a life cycle energy requirement of 11% to 14% less than the two light-frame wood envelopes, and a 10% to 12% lower life cycle GHG intensity. Although the increased thermal resistance certainly contributes to the superior life cycle performance of the ICF envelope, the improved infiltration leakage area of the envelope is key to its operational performance, and subsequently to its improved life cycle performance. End of life energy use for the demolition, recycle, and disposal of the building envelopes is nearly negligible, as it is attributed to less than 0.3% of the life cycle energy for any of the envelope scenarios.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Experience of Place and Body in the Built Form</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Shinn, Joshua R.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>“The place is the concrete manifestation of man’s dwelling, and his identity depends on his belonging to places.” (Norberg-Schulz 1980, 6)
Human existence is defined by our being in the world; the daily actions of individuals in places over time. To enhance this existence, it is necessary for us to connect to place, to become aware of the relationship between body and place. Architecture provides a venue to bring together body, place, and time. Architecture can articulate the experience of being-in-the-world; therefore, through the experience of architecture an individual can become aware of place. As we come to understand place, we begin to understand and define our sense of self. This connection between body and place, through the perception of Architecture provides a life-enhancing experience contributing to the existence of both body and place.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Age-related Histomorphometric Changes in Human Fetal Long Bones</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Eleazer, Courtney D.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The goal of this study is to investigate the age-related changes in histomorphometry among the six long bones of the human fetus. Histological studies have become increasingly important in distinguishing fragmentary human remains from non-human remains as well as estimating age at death in forensic cases. However, little work has been done with subadult material due to its distinct growth patterns and unique microscopic composition. This study attempts to provide a preliminary investigation into the potential of utilizing histomorphometry in the estimation of age at death of fetal remains. Microscopic methods may prove invaluable to the task of aging fragmentary remains that lack the characteristic features necessary for conventional metric methods that require the preservation of entire skeletal elements.
Seven stillborn cadavers of known sex and gestational age (17-35 weeks) were the subjects of study. Thin sections were taken from the midshafts of the six long bones and examined under a light microscope. For each slide, a maximum of 111 measurements were taken: maximum sagittal medullary diameter (anterior-posterior), maximum transverse medullary diameter (medial-lateral), medullary area, maximum cortical thickness (taken at each quadrant), minimum cortical thickness (taken at each quadrant), and a maximum of 25 separate trabecular diameters per quadrant.
The results of this research indicate that several histological measurements possess potential for predicting fetal age. Statistically significant correlations between both maximum and minimum cortical thicknesses and age were present for all six long bones. The humerus and tibia have the strongest correlations between cortical thickness and age, while the radius possesses the weakest correlation with age. The results of an ANCOVA employing age as a covariate indicate that fetal age is a significant linear predictor of trabecular thickness in all long bones except the radius. The values for trabecular thickness are significantly different among quadrants within the femur, tibia, humerus, and ulna. However, only in the humerus and radius does the rate of linear change in trabecular thickness with age differ by quadrant location. Future research conducted on a larger sample size is expected to determine the accuracy with which this method can be applied to fetal age estimation.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Cure-Induced Stress Control in Thermosetting Polymer Composites</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Burgess, Richard W</dc:creator>
<dc:description>During the cure of polymer matrix composites, induced stresses develop due to shrinkage of the matrix material. Consequences of this can lead to shifting of the reinforcement, adversely affecting final properties of the material, or the induced stresses can alter the final geometry of the part. With the use of a new closed loop feedback program developed, residual stresses built up during cure were minimized. Experiments were performed using the EPON 828 resin with two types of reinforcement, carbon and glass fiber. The residual stress built up during the optimized cure cycle was compared with that produced during the lPanufacturer recommended 2-step cure cycle and isothermal cure cycles. Results for both fibers show a large reduction in stresses endured during cure for the optimized cure compared to typical stresses seen under isothermal and standard cure cycles. Static and dynamic testing were done on specimens and showed that the modulus and the glass transition temperatures of cured specimens were not significantly affected by the optimized cure cycles. Results also show that optimized cure cycles were of shorter duration compared to the standard cure cycles.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Valluru, Sri Harish</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Basic research in smart materials and structural systems has demonstrated great potential for enhancing the functionality, serviceability and durability of civil and mechanical infrastructure systems. These smart materials (like piezoelectric materials) can be used as mechanisms to transfer mechanical energy, usually ambient vibration, into electrical energy that can be stored and used to power other devices. The intelligent renewal of aging and deteriorating civil and mechanical infrastructure systems includes efficient and innovative use of high performance sensors, actuators, and structural systems. In this work, a computational model is developed to generate power from the ambient vibration of a single span simply supported bridge (civil structure) due to a moving load, using PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) as a piezoelectric material for energy harvesting. A commercially available finite element software ABAQUS is used for analysis. The structure is analyzed using 2-dimensional 8-noded quadratic elements. Also, the concept of application of moving load in a finite element code has been well defined and is compared with the mathematical model of a simply supported beam subjected to a moving constant force developed by Fryba (1970). The method of integral transformations is used to derive the displacement equation.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Moisture Degradation of CTD-403: Testing the Application of Cyanate Ester Insulations to Fusion Devices</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Morgan, Bradley Ian</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The fusion devices currently being developed present several challenges for magnet designers. One challenge lies within the electrical insulation, which must be able to withstand extreme temperatures (both cryogenic and elevated temperatures), large shear and compressive stresses, high operating voltages, and high levels of incident radiation. To address the need for better performing insulation systems, Composite Technology Development, Inc. (CTD) has developed CTD-403, a cyanate ester resin with increased radiation resistance, ease of processing and fabrication, low moisture absorption characteristics, and high mechanical and electrical strength at cryogenic and elevated temperatures.
In this thesis, CTD-403 resin based insulation systems were tested under the operation guidelines of the Quasi-Poloidal Stellarator (QPS). Because the coils of QPS are water cooled, it is important to understand the effects of long term humidity exposure on the insulation. The effects of humidity on moisture absorption characteristics, dimensional stability, mechanical and electrical properties were characterized. Increasing the humidity level caused a corresponding increase in the saturation level, while increasing the temperature of exposure magnified these effects causing more pronounced non-Fickian behavior. The mechanical properties degraded with an increase in humidity level. Elevated temperature effects are more pronounced on the compressive properties than the tensile properties. The glass transition temperature was more greatly affected by elevated temperature exposure as opposed to increased humidity exposure, decreasing in both instances. The dielectric strength decreases with increased humidity level and exposure time.
Based on these findings, the performance of cyanate ester resin based insulation systems is shown superior to that of traditional epoxy based resin systems in all performance measures. The degradation of the mechanical and electrical properties of the insulation from long term effects of humidity and elevated temperature exposure are shown to be within the performance criteria bounds, and the insulation is therefore recommended for use in current and future fusion programs.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Stretching with whole body vibration versus traditional static stretches to increase acute hamstring range of motion</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bourne, Anastasia Elizabeth</dc:creator>
<dc:description>PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to determine if performing static active knee extension hamstring stretching using the Pneumex Pro-Vibe vibrating platform increased acute hamstring range of motion (ROM) greater than traditional static active knee extension hamstring stretching. METHODS: A within subject design was utilized with subjects undergoing static stretching with vibration and without vibration (conditions counterbalanced). Pre- and post-test active and passive ROM was measured for the right leg, with subjects first undergoing a 5-minute warm-up on a stationary bicycle. Supine active knee extension was performed on the Pro-Vibe platform with and without vibration. The stretch was held 3 times each for 30 seconds, with a 20-second rest period between each stretch. Vibration was set at 30 Hz at the “high” amplitude setting. Active hamstring ROM was measured via active knee extension using a goniometer with the leg in 90° of hip flexion. Passive ROM was measured via clinician-assisted knee extension with the leg in 90° of hip flexion. RESULTS: A 2-way repeated measures ANOVA was performed for passive ROM, and revealed a significant main effect for condition, F (1, 23) = 0.5875, p &lt; 0.05, and time, F (1, 23) = 5.029, p &lt; 0.05. Another repeated measures ANOVA was performed for active ROM with the same factors, and revealed a significant time by condition interaction, F (1, 23) = 4.730, p &lt; 0.05, and a significant main effect for time, F (1, 23) = 18.612, p &lt; 0.001.
Post-hoc paired samples t-tests determined the difference between the pre-test and post-test measurements for each condition. Active ROM showed a significant difference pre-test to post-test for the vibration condition, t (23) = -5.41, p &lt; 0.001. The vibration condition also resulted in significantly different pre-test vs. post-test measurements on passive ROM, t (23) = -2.55, p &lt; 0.05. In both cases the average ROM was higher for the post-test. DISCUSSION: Three 30-second active knee extension hamstring stretches using a vibrating platform are sufficient to cause significant acute increases in hamstring ROM. These findings suggest this device may be useful when desiring increased hamstring ROM.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Automated System to Debug Under-performing Network Flows in Wide Area Networks</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Tandra, Harika</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Locating the cause of performance losses in large high performance Wide Area Networks (WAN) is an extremely challenging problem. This is because WANs comprise several distributed sub-networks (Autonomous Networks), with their own independent network monitoring systems. Each individual monitoring system has limited or no access to network devices outside its own network. Moreover, conventional network monitoring systems are designed only to provide information about the health of individual network devices, and do not provide sufficient information to monitor endto- end performance – thus, adding severe overhead on debugging end-toend performance issues.
In this thesis, an automated tool is designed that requires no special access to network devices and no special software installations on the network devices or end hosts. The system detects performance losses and locates the most likely problem nodes (routers/links) in the network. A key component of this system is the novel hybrid network monitoring/data collection system. The monitoring/data collection sub-system is designed to obtain the best of both active and passive monitoring techniques. Then, pattern analysis algorithms are designed. They locate the causes of performance loss using the data collected from above sub-system.
This system is being tested on the GLORIAD (Global Ring Network for Advanced Application Development) network. One of the future goals is to in tegrate this system into the GLORIAD’s network monitoring tool set, to provide end-to-end network monitoring and problem mitigation capabilities.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>State Libraries in the United States: Identifying and Meeting the Challenges of the Twenty- First Century</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Treadway, Sandra G</dc:creator>
<dc:description>State libraries are important organizations within the library community in the United States, yet little has been written about them and students learn almost nothing about them in the course of graduate study in library and information sciences. State libraries’ contributions to their profession and the citizens they serve are not as well known as they should be nor are they appropriately acknowledged beyond their immediate constituencies.
This study examines a sample of nine state libraries during the past twenty years – three that are highly successful (the California State Library, the New York State Library, and the Library of Michigan), three that are typical of the majority of state libraries (the Georgia Public Library Service, the State Library of Kansas, and the Tennessee State Library and Archives), and three whose survival was placed in jeopardy in the recent past (the Florida State Library and Archives, the Minnesota State Library, and the Washington State Library) – to highlight their role within the greater library community and to analyze their successes and challenges. Research was conducted in primary and secondary sources such as annual reports, strategic plans, newspapers, newsletters, library association periodicals, web sites, and other similar material produced by or written about the nine state libraries to determine what conditions or combination of conditions are conducive to state libraries flourishing and what other factors or combinations of factors might contribute to the weakening or decline of state libraries. Based on this research, this study offers recommendations concerning what state libraries might do in the future to make themselves more visible within their states and within the larger library community.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Modeling the ground state baryon octet using a generalization of the Lagrange triangle solution</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Duran, Matthew P</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The baryon octet is modeled using relativistic and nonrelativistic Hamiltonians with interquark confining potentials. Using the works of Crater, a nonrelativistic three-body Hamiltonian is obtained where the corresponding eigenvalue equation will be shown to be separable and can be treated as three two-body like systems. Next, using relativistic constraint dynamics, our eigenvalue equation is treated relativistically following the works of Sazdjian and Yang. Using the free-mass-shell Hamiltonian constraints, Yang gives us an effective energy and reduced mass of relative motion for two particle systems which we expand to a three body case. With the help of work done by Sazdjian, we get a generalized 3-body eigenvalue equation in which the energy and reduced masses of effective particles of relative motion are expanded to obtain a form for the eigenvalue equation that can be solved analytically. Because we are dealing with only part of the entire baryon spectrum in which the particles are of the same spin and baryon number, attention will be focused upon confining forces and the development of potentials that are independent of spin and the relative momenta of the fermions. v</dc:description>

<dc:description>In Live Ghosts, Patricia (Patty) Ireland offers a gathering of short stories based upon real life characters she encountered while growing up in the South. Exploring the diversity, complexity and moral ambiguity of those we might normally perceive as being stereotypically “Southern,” Ireland’s tales encompass a variety of time periods, settings, and characters, including: a modern-day family struggling to reconcile the reality of death, interracial lovers in the early 1950’s who are descended from masters and slaves, and an insane killer locked for life in a mental institution of the 1990’s. Live Ghosts is infused with tales of fear, love, loss, regret, madness, and self discovery, themes intrinsic not only to Southern culture, but to the universal vulnerability in all of us.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Do Thigh Circumference and Mass Changes Associated With Obesity Alter Walking Biomechanics?</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Westlake, Carolyn Grace</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Differences in gait biomechanics have been observed between obese and healthy weight adults.  It is possible that body segment parameters, particularly the thigh, contribute to the differences in knee biomechanics observed during gait between obese and healthy weight adults.  The purpose of this study was to determine if increases in thigh circumference and/or mass associated with obesity alter walking biomechanics in healthy weight males and females.  Thigh mass and circumference were increased proportional to a 10 unit increase in body mass index.  Frontal and sagittal plane knee angles and moments, and temporospatial variables were recorded.   For all dependent variables no main effect for gender was observed.  Peak knee flexion angle was similar across conditions with no interaction.  There was an interaction for peak internal knee extension moment however post hoc comparisons did not reveal differences in condition among males or females.  A main effect for condition was observed for peak knee adduction angle, however post hoc comparisons did not reveal differences among conditions.  Peak internal knee abduction moment was similar across conditions with no interaction.  Stance time and step width increased during the experimental conditions compared to the control.  A interaction was observed for stance time.  Females had a longer stance time during the circumference only condition compared to the control condition.  A greater step width was observed in conditions that increased thigh circumference.  Overall, thigh segment parameters altered gait temporospatial variables.  Increases in stance time and step width in obese adults compared to healthy weight adults could be a result of their larger thigh segment parameters.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Design and Implementation of a Field-Scale Monitoring System to Evaluate Spatial Variability within Production Cotton Fields</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Palmer, Michael Spencer</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Much interest has been focused on site-specific crop production since the introduction of grain yield monitoring systems. Considerable research has been conducted in the area of site-specific grain production. Lack of a cotton yield monitor has slowed implementation of site-specific practices in cotton production. However, due to the intense level of management corrunonly associated with in cotton production. it may prove to be an ideal crop for site-specific practices.
Preliminary testing was conducted in the fall of 1995 to verify that a batch weighing system used in conjunction with Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment was a satisfactory method of monitoring cotton yield variability for field-scale research. The objective of the yield monitoring system was to enable field-scale research, rather than being restricted by small plots. The weighing system was improved in 1996 by increasing the weighing capacity, ease of operation, and reduction of the basket weight to cotton capacity ratio.
In 1996 a five-acre portion of a production cotton field in Milan, Tennessee was selected to monitor spatial variation throughout the growing season. The field was divided into 182 plots. An extensive soil survey was performed on the field in the spring revealing six soil series within the test area. Soil samples were extracted and analyzed from each plot in the spring and the fall. Soil moisture was monitored throughout the growing season from 26 observation sites within the test area.
The overall objective of the research was to relate soil chemical and physical variability within a production field to crop yield. 1996 field data was the first of collected a three-year study. Therefore, information obtained from 1996 field data collected cannot be considered conclusive without statistical replication. It should be noted that weather patterns tend to have an effect on spatial performance of crops. Although some of the variables measured during the first year had a greater affect on yields than others.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Appeasing the Animal</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lamour, Kierstyn G.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>“Appeasing the Animal” is collection of thirty-two poems that represent a fight and conciliation between the civilized self and the spectrum of human needs in a socially constructed reality.  These explorations were split into male and female representations of the human psyche.  This intersection is also a place that investigates mothers &amp; daughters, politics, sex, crisis, religion, and other important points of dramatic conflict.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Influences of Climate and Anthropogenic Disturbances on Wildfire Regimes of the Zuni Mountains, New Mexico, U.S.A.</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Rother, Monica Tyson</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This research examined the fire history of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Douglas ex P. Lawson &amp; C. Lawson) forests in northwestern New Mexico. The study area included three sites in the Zuni Mountains of Cibola National Forest and one site along the boundary of El Malpais National Monument. I crossdated over 800 fire scars on 75 samples to reconstruct spatial and temporal characteristics of historic wildfire regimes. The Weibull Median Interval, Weibull Modal Interval, and Mean Fire Interval ranged from five to eight years across all sites and percent-scarred classes (all fires, 10% scarred, and 25% scarred) and indicated that low-severity wildfires occurred frequently in the study area during the period 1700 to 1880.
Wildfires were historically driven by climatic variability. Superposed Epoch Analyses revealed that wetter conditions typically occurred one to three years prior to a fire event and were followed by drought during the fire year. No relationship was found between the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and wildfire occurrence. These findings implied that shorter-term fluxes between wet and dry conditions, rather than longer-term climatic variability, were historically most conducive to fire occurrence. Fire frequency decreased suddenly in the late 19th century across the study area, and results indicated that fire has been absent at all sites since the 1920s. Anthropogenic disturbances including livestock grazing, timber harvesting, and fire suppression likely explain observed differences between historic and contemporary wildfire regimes in the Zuni Mountains.
This research has important implications for forest management. In ponderosa pine forests of the southwestern United States, land managers often aim to restore historic ecological conditions. The reintroduction of a frequent, low-severity wildfire regime might restore some ecological patterns and processes, but given the strong legacy of human disturbances and the influences of human-induced climate change, a complete return to historic conditions may be neither possible nor desired.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Study on the Effectiveness of a Self-Fit Mandibular Repositioning Appliance on Increasing Human Strength and Endurance Capabilities</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Alexander, Cherie Faye</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Years of study and constant anecdotal infonnation dating back to the ancient Romans exists regarding the relationship of mandibular position, occlusion surface changes, and human performance. Such old sayings and practices like &quot;bite the bullet&quot; and the actual act ofclenching one's teeth on a stick prior to exertion or in anticipation ofpain are but two examples of how this relationship has been intuitively understood by man for some time. Previous scientific works in this area have generally suffered at least one serious shortcoming in data collection, data analysis, test device flaws or lack of control measures. There seem to be emotionally charged efforts to either prove or disprove the apparent relationship between jaw positioning and human performance. It is unclear why there has been so much controversy but the fact that this emotional side taking exists leads to concerns about preconceptions on the part ofthe previous research teams. In an effort to reach some realistic levels of confidence, this effort has been accomplished in a double blind, placebo controlled, unbiased manner utilizing the tenets of the scientific method throughout. The data indicate that a self-fit, intra-oral device is beneficial in improving grip strength values for both men and women at a confidence level of at least 95 percent. In addition, there is a 96 percent confidence level that a mandibular repositioning appliance is of greater assistance in grip strength tests than a placebo device. Therefore, the results of this research initiative demonstrate that statistically relevant human performance increases are possible by employing a self-fit, intra-oral device in active men and women ofall ages.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>INACTIVATION OF &lt;i&gt;ALICYCLOBACILLUS ACIDOTERRESTRIS&lt;/i&gt; USING HIGH PRESSURE HOMOGENIZATION AND DIMETHYL DICARBONATE</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Chen, Wei</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris is a spore-forming food spoilage bacterium. Its spore is problematic to the juice industry because of its ability to grow in low pH environments and survive pasteurization processes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the non-thermal technology, high pressure homogenization (HPH) and the antimicrobial compound, dimethyl dicarbonate (DMDC), on inactivation of A. acidoterrestris, in a broth system. Vegetative cells and spores of five strains of A. acidoterrestris (N-1100, N-1108, N-1096, SAC and OS-CAJ) were screened for their sensitivity to HPH (0, 100, 200 and 300 MPa) in Bacilllus acidoterrestris thermophilic (BAT) broth. Strain SAC (most resistant) and OS-CAJ (least resistant) were further tested for their sensitivity to 250 ppm DMDC. This was followed by evaluation of combined effects of HPH and DMDC against strain SAC. Effects of HPHand DMDC treatment combinations (no DMDC, 250 ppm DMDC added 12 h before, 2 h before, immediately before, and immediately after 300 MPa HPH treatment) on spores of SAC over a 24-h period were evaluated. After all treatments, samples were serially diluted and surface plated onto BAT agar, and the populations were determined after incubation at 44 &amp;degC for 48 h. All HPH and DMDC treatments significantly (P&lt;0.05) inhibited growth of vegetative cells, spores were less affected by these treatments. HPH caused a 1-to 2-log reduction in vegetative cell populations at 300 MOa for four strains, but only about 0.5-log reduction of SAC strain. Spores of all five strains were not significantly reduced by HPH. DMDC also slowed growth of vegetative cells significantly. For vegetative cells of SAC and OS-CAJ, 250 ppm DMDC reduced the population by about 2 log whereas spore population was reduced by less than 0.5 log. The addition of DMDC together with HPH slightly enhanced the inactivation effect over a 24-h period as compared with treatment with HPH alone. These results demonstrate that HPH and DMDC show promise for aiding in control of growth of vegetative cells of A. acidoterrestris. However, neither treatment alone or in combination, is very effective against spores.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Some Relationships of Vegetation to Soil and Site Factors on Wilson Mountain, Morgan County, Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Martin III, William Haywood</dc:creator>
<dc:description>INTRODUCTION
In this study, the forest composition of Wilson Mountain, Morgan County, Tennessee, is described and distribution of tree taxa and site factors are related.
The study arose from the need for geographic knowledge of an area where resource understanding is of great national concern, and to provide data for characterization of local forest and soil resources as an aid in their management. Of further interest is characterization of the genetic and ecological amplitude of forest tree taxa in this area close to the center of Deciduous Forest diversity.
The objectives in this study of the vegetation of Wilson Mountain were: (a) to describe the pattern of tree communities, (b) to analyze the variation in environmental factors which may be responsible for the distribution of tree taxa, (c) to evaluate the degree of correlation between environmental factors and vegetational pattern, (d) to determine if variation in characteristics of overstory and understory tree taxa was related to soil characteristics, slope direction and (or) topography.
Tree vegetation occupying approximately 830 acres of Wilson Mountain was sampled during the summer months of 1965.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Production and Optimization of Continuous Roving-Like UTSI Pitch based Carbon Fiber Composites</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Duran, Matthew P</dc:creator>
<dc:description>UTSI has developed a new low-cost jet-dry-spin method for the production of mesophase pitch-based carbon fibers. The objective of this preliminary study is to optimize the production of the UTSI carbon fiber composites and to better understand the surface texture between the fiber and matrix material. Several fabrication techniques were studied with varied preparation conditions to determine the effects on apparent density, electrical resistivity, tensile and flexural properties. Various polymeric resins and hardeners were used to demonstrate the versatility of the application of UTSI carbon fibers. During these investigations various analysis techniques including Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction, and optical microscope aided in the determination of the structural characteristics of the fiber and its composite.
It was found that vacuum bagging resin infusion is the optimal fabrication process due to its ability to minimize porosity and increase fiber volume/content. The use of extra slow hardener allowed excellent control over the wetting, degassing, and cure time. Increasing applied pressure during the fabrication of the composites increases the fiber content/volume leading to improvements in mechanical properties, apparent density and electrical conductivity. However, excessive pressure causes difficult diffusion of the resin and the crash of carbon fibers which decrease the above properties. A preliminary work also shows that low cost phenolic resin composites and converted C/C composites can be easily prepared using UTSI CF.
Fiber surface oxidative treatments with ozone and HNO3 solution were performed for comparison and optimization. Single-fiber fragmentation tests including single-fiber tensile/diameter testing revealed improvements in interfacial shear strength between oxidized carbon fiber (CF) and epoxy resin. Ozone treatment proved to be optimal, increasing flexure strength two-fold with respect to composites fabricated using as received CF.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>&quot;You're pretty good for a girl&quot;: Roles of women in bluegrass music</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lawson, Jenna Michele</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis explores the past and current roles that female bluegrass musicians achieve within the music industry in the United States. Using sociological concepts by Judith Butler, Simon Frith, Mavis Bayton, and, importantly, Thomas Turino’s ideas of participatory and communal versus performative and individual, I demonstrate women’s complex musical, social, and cultural positions in bluegrass culture.
While women continue to make strides in achieving recognition in the bluegrass genre, society still hinders them from finding complete acceptance alongside male musicians. As bluegrass music is based on patriarchal foundations set by its creator, Bill Monroe of the Blue Grass Boys, female bluegrass musicians constantly struggle to variously actualize and resist this gendered model. Even as bluegrass women achieve success through manipulation of the traditional rules set before them, they continue to struggle against patriarchal foundations and women’s historical association with the voice.
Through historical research, personal observations, and in-depth interviews with three female bluegrass musicians, I show that even as these women find acceptance within their own bands, they recognize the unequal musical acknowledgement they receive. With regard to communal and individual performance realms, women, unlike men, have trouble fulfilling positions in both areas. In order to achieve success, some bluegrass women embrace their sexuality and present an overtly feminine image to their audiences.
Notions of tradition, authenticity and hybridity help frame my discussion of women’s roles. While the power of tradition and authenticity hinder women’s progress in the genre, concepts of hybridity allow them to branch out from conventions set down by first generation male bluegrass performers like Bill Monroe and the Stanley Brothers.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An Analysis of the Spatial Distribution of Chiefdom Settlements: Modeling the Mississippian Culture in the Tennessee River Valley</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Witcoski, Jonathan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Location-allocation models based on optimization criteria are appropriate tools for the analysis of archaeological settlement patterns. In early agricultural societies, elite classes might maximize their control of the population and resources by optimally situating their primary settlements. Location-allocation models can simulate the multiple factors that potentially underlie settlement site location decisions. I describe several maximal covering models and their applicability to understand the degree of political centralization in the Upper Tennessee River Valley during several Mississippian archaeological cultural phases (900 to 1600 A.D.). My results support the notion that the main objective of the Mississippian elite in choosing sites for administrative centers was to maximize control of the local population and the supporting agricultural economy. The results also support the work of anthropologists and archaeologists regarding the variable degrees of political complexity during time periods of the Mississippian culture. Cultures during the earliest time period (1000-1200 A.D.) and the northern part of the study area during the latest time period (1450-1600 A.D.) in the analysis were found to be the least complex, resembling simple tribal societies unable to maximize their control over the entire Valley population and its resources. Factors such as the location of trade routes and selected resource deposits were not accounted for in the location-allocation models developed for this research and may account for the less-than-optimal results in settlement system control.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Anti-Judaic Religious Polemic and Apocalyptic Thought in the &lt;em&gt;Disputation of Majorca&lt;/em&gt; and its Later Manuscript Tradition</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Martin, Geoffrey Kyle</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this study, I first examine the Disputation of Majorca (1286) and analyze how its Christian disputant, Inghetto Contardo, blended apocalyptic thought and anti-Judaic discourse. Although other studies, most notably Ora Limor’s critical edition, have touched upon the nature of Inghetto’s arguments, none have discussed his clear implementation of intertwined anti-Judaic religious polemic and apocalyptic thought in a satisfactory manner. I place Inghetto in an apocalyptic milieu of the later thirteenth century that especially emphasizes the imminence of the Last Days. In effect, Inghetto’s employment of St. Jerome’s Daniel exegesis is perfectly suited to 1286, when Jews are most likely to believe a Christian telling them that Daniel prophesies on Christ’s Second Coming in 1290.
The latter half of my thesis continues to emphasize the close ties between religious polemic and apocalyptic thought that are present in the Disputation. Here, I argue that Heinrich of Oberburg, the scribe of Vatican City, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana MS Lat. 4074, a fifteenth-century manuscript including the Disputation, copied this codex specifically for a religious audience interested in the twelfth-century abbot Joachim of Fiore’s viri spirituales, a mix of canons, friars, and Jews who would receive heavenly rewards in return for the reforms they would carry out during the End Times. BAV MS Lat. 4074 contains a previously unstudied excerpt from Joachim’s Liber de concordia that describes hermeneutical connections between the Old and New Testaments and collectively intensifies the Daniel prophecies already present in the Disputation. Moreover, I continually argue that Heinrich envisioned his audience employing anti-Judaic polemic in the midst of all their apocalyptic expectation, with the understanding that engaging in disputation was part of the viri spirituales’ role and would help them earn God’s promised rewards.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Modern Frequency and the Significance of Acromial Shape in the Etiological Debate of Os Acromiale</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Villao, Lorena</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Os acromiale was first described by the anatomist Grüber in 1859. In later anthropological studies, os acromiale has subsequently been referred to as a genetic marker among African-American populations. However, Blakey (2000) and Rankin-Hill (1997) point out that biomechanical stress should be considered as a possible cause of this trait. This population has a harsh history, which is evidenced in the skeletal remains via nutritional deficiency, disease, and markers of occupational stress. A trait interpreted as genetic, may in fact be another stress marker. Frequency rates (%) in the William M. Bass donated skeletal collection, representing a modern sample, were compared to data from African-American skeletal samples spanning the last 300+ years. A lower frequency among modern samples may support a functional argument as a result of technological advancements leading to reduced physiological stress. The comparative African-American samples, examined here, include (in chronological order): New York African Burial Ground (7.6%), First African Baptist Church (20%), Mother United African Methodist Episcopalian Church (2.9%), Terry (11.1%), and the Hamann-Todd Collection (13.2%). Both the New York African Burial Ground and Mother UAME are samples presented for the first time. Unlike other samples, their frequency is not high. The Bass data, collected from a sample of 420 individuals, yielded an overall frequency of os acromiale at 3.3%. This is a decrease from the average frequency of 7% cited in the clinical literature. However, the frequency rate among the African-American component of this collection is a high os acromiale frequency, of 10.8% (n=4/37). The European- American frequency of the William M. Bass collection is quite low at 2.6% (n=10/383). In general, the African-American os acromiale frequencies are not always high as they have been presented. Further investigation may reveal that the underlying cause of the high os acromiale frequencies may involve additional factors. One factor may be acromial shape. The shape categories as classified by Edelson and Taitz (1992), is argued to reveal the underlying genetic cause of high os acromiale frequencies. If certain acromial shapes prove to be positively correlated to specific ancestral groups, then this could illustrate the genetic cause is a result of variation. However, if acromial shape varies in spite of ancestry, other mechanical arguments should be examined. While this research is not meant to present the last word on the etiology of this trait, it is meant to examine modern os acromiale frequencies, specifically in reference to acromial shape. The former is to test a mechanical etiology and the latter to test a genetic etiology.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Relationship of the Language Skills Required for Reading and Speech Reading Skills for Children with Hearing Impairment</dc:title>
<dc:creator>McLoone, Christine</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Currently there is no model of the development of reading skills currently exists for children with hearing impairments. Using the framework of a commonly excepted model of reading for children with typical hearing researchers have sought to determine how children with hearing impairments develop reading skills. The purpose of this is study was to examine a possible link between two components of reading development, speech reading and language. Participants consisted of 5 school aged children with severe to profound hearing loss with cochlear implants or hearing aids. These children were administered the CELF-4 and a department created speech reading test. Results indicated that children with poor language scores had the best speech reading scores while the child with good language scores had poor speech reading score. Performance on tasks examining syntax proved to be crucial to performance on speech reading tasks.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Stress and Eating Behaviors:  A Systematic Review</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sieber, Jessica L.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Background: The effects of psychological stress on eating behaviors either through psychological/social influences (i.e. comfort foods, learned behaviors) or psychoneuroendocrine pathways have been studied for many years; however, a review of current research is lacking. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic literature review of the relationship between stress and eating behaviors with a concentration on how stress and eating behaviors are measured.
Methods: PubMed and PsycINFO databases were searched to identify peer-reviewed English-language human studies published between 1966 and March 2006. Keywords and subject headings used were: stress, eating, feeding behaviors, food habits, energy intake, diet, appetite, stress-related eating, stress eating, stress induced eating, and dietary restraint. This resulted in the retrieval of 1025 citations. Numerous exclusion criteria were applied and after review, 50 articles were deemed relevant and included in the study.
Results: There is little consistency in either measurement of stress or measurement of eating behavior. Despite the heterogeneity in both exposure and outcomes, studies have found some relationships between stress and eating. Stress may impact intake by increasing or decreasing frequency of eating or increasing selection of foods high in fat, sugar, and/or salt.
Conclusions: The variety in the measurement of both stress and eating behavior in the stress-eating literature has produced wide-ranging and somewhat inconsistent results. Oftentimes the participants are studied in either a laboratory setting or at only one point in time, both of which are insufficient to measure overall changes in diet caused by stress. Further research, including more comprehensive assessment of eating behavior changes caused by stress, is needed to better understand the stress-eating relationship and its possible health effects. In the fast-paced society we live in, many individuals experience high levels of stress on a daily basis, creating the potential to significantly contribute to unhealthy dietary behaviors both immediately and long-term.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>North Platte Snowpack Reconstructions Using Dendrochronology</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bowen, Amanda Kate</dc:creator>
<dc:description>April 1st Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) reconstructions were generated using tree-ring chronologies for the Upper North Platte River Basin (UNPRB), located in north-central Colorado and south-eastern Wyoming.  To regionalize April 1st snowpack data from 11 SNOw TELemetry stations (SNOTEL stations), Varimax Rotated Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was used.  For the 11 station regionalization, the reconstruction explained 42% of the variance in the instrumental record and extended the record to 1378 (632 years).  Retained tree-ring chronologies included those that were stable and positively correlated at 99% confidence levels or higher with the regional snowpack data for a 60–year overlapping period of record from 1940 to 1999.  Stepwise Linear Regression was performed for the overlapping (calibration) period to develop regression models for the reconstructions.  Eleven stations were individually reconstructed of which three stations (Dry Lake, Old Battle, and Lake Irene) explained variances greater than 40%.  A contour plot of the R2 values for all 11 stations revealed that the more statistically skillful reconstructions were for stations spatially adjacent to the tree-ring chronologies used in the regression models.  When the two individual stations with the lowest explained variance were removed from the 11 station snowpack regionalization, the new nine station regionalization reconstruction explained 45% of the variance over the same 632 year period.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Changes in Body Composition and Physical Activity Behavior in a Group of College Freshmen</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Swibas, Tracy A</dc:creator>
<dc:description>PURPOSE: To compare: 1-the physiological profile of former athletes (Ath) and non-athletes (Non-Ath) upon college entrance, 2-PA levels in these groups, and 3-changes in physiological profile and PA level of former Ath and Non-Ath and females and males over the course of freshman year. Sixty-two college freshmen were tested during the initial weeks of the school year and again during the final weeks of the school year; the sample consisted of 32 former Ath (18 females and 14 males) and 30 Non-Ath (19 females and 11 males). METHODS: Body composition (BC) was assessed using the Bod Pod with a conversion of body density to body fat percentage (%BF) using the Siri equation. PA was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), and 7 days of steps were counted using a pedometer. RESULTS: Upon entrance into college, Ath and Non-Ath had similar BC. Daily average number of steps was similar among the groups (Ath: 11212±2729steps; Non-Ath 11191±3735). However, median MET-minutes of weekly total PA (TPA) was higher in Ath (2737 METmin/wk) than Non-Ath (1613 METmin/wk). Over the course of freshmen year, there was a significantly larger drop in TPA for Ath (-1006±2126 MET-min/wk) than Non-Ath (140±2458 MET-min/wk). Overall, Ath had a higher fat free mass (p=0.046). The overall sample experienced unhealthy changes in BC, with a significant average weight gain of 1.81 kg±2.59 kg and a significant decline in daily steps. Males had a significantly larger decline in steps than females (-2374±3720 steps/day vs. -929±2596 steps/day). The overall sample also had a significant decrease in median TPA (2134 MET-min/wk to 1725 MET-min/wk). However there was a wide variation of changes in BC and PA; some had large changes while others had small or none. CONCLUSION: Generally, there were small but unhealthy changes in BC and decreases in PA during freshman year. Former athletes enter college with initially higher activity level when compared to Non-Ath; however this difference disappears by the end of freshmen year. The key is to determine factors that contribute to the large changes in certain individuals and to pinpoint factors that influence college students’ PA behavior.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Citizens (or citoyennes) of the World: Women’s Citizenship and Exile in the French Revolutionary Years 1789-1793</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Christian, Lisa Michelle</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study examines the fluid definitions of citizenship during the French Revolution, especially citizenship’s relationship to exile. I assert that citizenship was always defined by who could not be citizens. Furthermore, this study focuses upon women’s experience of citizenship and exile for their especial vulnerability to exclusion from public and political affairs. In particular, I address the political actions of Parisian common women, and the political actions and writings of the English exiles Helen Maria Williams and Mary Wollstonecraft. Essentially, this study has three distinct parts that demonstrate the development of women’s citizenship during the Revolution and the causes of their official exile from active citizenship. First, I examine the historical situation of the October Days, when Parisian market-women drew upon traditional female political action to perform a militant citizenship in the new régime. Next, I move from the physical to the mediated experiences of revolution as I examine the initial responses of Edmund Burke, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Helen Maria Williams, and their different definitions of citizenship based upon a bourgeois English identity. Lastly, I examine Williams and Wollstonecraft’s experiences as exiles in France leading up to and during the Terror, the ways in which both English women negotiated the ever-restricting and nationalistic definitions of citizenship of the Jacobin régime while maintaining their cosmopolitan ideals. Furthermore, Williams and Wollstonecraft’s definition of bourgeois cosmopolitan citizenship was diametrically opposed to the popular sovereignty promoted by the Parisian common women. In the end, I seek to demonstrate that women, whatever their class or nationality, were always acting or attempting to define citizenship from a position of exile.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Effectiveness of Polyacrylamide in Reducing Turbidity Caused by High Clay Sediment: A Study of the Impacts of Blends, Mixing, and Sediment Concentrations</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Brotherton, Kenton Michael</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Polyacrylamide was studied for its efficacy in reducing turbidity. The purpose of this research was to determine optimum conditions for 10 blends of PAM to reduce turbidity from construction site runoff. The research was based on 10 different PAM blends, researching concentrations (0, 1, 5, 10 ppm), PAM forms (dry granular or solution), mixing powers (80 and 150 rpm), and mixing times (1 and 2 minutes). The research was conducted in a laboratory setting using a PB-700TM Standard Jar Tester (Phipps and Bird, Richmond, Virginia) with a clay texture sediment source. The claytextured sediment source was researched under two sediment-water concentrations of 2,000 and 10,000 parts per million (ppm). For non-polymer control, each sediment concentration was mixed for five minutes to ensure complete mixing. One minute after the cessation of mixing, turbidity measurements were taken on time intervals of 0.5, 2, 5, and 10 minutes. Using these same samples, polyacrylamide was then added to the sediment-water solution. Three replicates of the various treatment conditions, and similar turbidity measurements were then taken.
The data showed the most key aspects, on the average at reducing turbidity the greatest, were the dry forms of PAM for the 2,000 ppm sediment-water concentration and the solution forms of PAM for the 10,000 ppm sediment-water concentrations. Turbidity reductions were not as dramatic with the dry from of PAM, at the lower mixing power, with the shorter mixing time, at low PAM concentrations.
The data also provided evidence that all PAM blends demonstrate different turbidity reduction under different treatment combinations. This information shows the important issue that PAM is not exactly 100% PAM and each PAM product (blend) are very soil dependent. This key issue needs to be considered when a PAM product is applied in any form or fashion.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Management of ticks and tick-borne disease in a Tennessee retirement community</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Harmon, Jessica Rose</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Human Monocytic Ehrlichiosis (HME) is an emerging disease first described in 1987 and is transmitted by the bite of Amblyomma americanum.  Over the past 10 years, the CDC has documented increasing ehrlichiosis case reports nationwide.  Our study site is a golf-oriented retirement community located in the Cumberland Plateau of Tennessee. In 1993, four men at the study site had symptoms consistent with HME which prompted a CDC outbreak investigation and led community managers to mitigate ticks feeding on deer. The objectives of this study were to measure the efficacy of current tick mitigation attempts, to determine the level of infection and composition of tick-borne disease in the study area, and to assess which wildlife species are potentially acting as reservoirs for disease.
Ticks were sampled in the community at eight sites of ‘4-poster’ acaricide applicator utilization and at seven untreated sites. Close to the ‘4-poster’ devices, larval, nymphal, and adult tick abundances were reduced by 90%, 68% and 49% respectively (larval p&lt;0.001, nymphal p&lt;0.001, adult p=0.005) relative to the untreated areas. We extracted DNA from A. americanum ticks collected at the treatment and non-treatment sites and tested for Ehrlichia spp. infections. Of 253 adult and nymphal A. americanum tested, we found 1.2% to be positive for Ehrlichia chaffeensis, 4.7% positive for Ehrlichia ewingii, and 1.6% positive for Panola Mountain Ehrlichia; in combination this prevalence is similar to that reported in other Ehrlichia-endemic areas of the eastern U.S.. We also performed blood meal analysis on DNA from A. americanum ticks and the results suggest that the most significant reservoir hosts for Ehrlichia spp. are white-tailed deer, turkeys, grey squirrels, and Passeriformes.
We conclude that while the ‘4-poster’ acaricide applicators reduce the number of ticks close to treatment, at the density at which they are currently being used (8 applicators per 52.6 km2, average distance between applicators = 6.6km) they will have no large-scale effect on the community’s tick population. In order to accomplish area-wide reduction of A.americanum and Ehrlichia spp. in this locale, community managers should develop an integrated management strategy that utilizes other techniques in addition to ‘4-poster’ devices.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Characterization of the Temperature Dependence of Optical Components in a Cryo-Vacuum Chamber used for Space Sensor Testing</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Labello, Jesse M.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The space sensor cryo-vacuum chambers at Arnold Air Force Base are world class sensor characterization and calibration facilities. The chambers provide a simulated deep space background and accurate infrared projections. Several large optical systems are used within the chambers to accomplish this. Calibration of the chambers requires the use of a database of the measured optical properties of these components to simulate the output. However, as the information in the database is room temperature information and the chambers run near 20K, some discrepancies exist between the actual output and the model output. The purpose of this work is to translate the room temperature spectral information to cryogenic information as correctly as possible. To achieve this, the relevant temperature dependent material information was collected from literature. A program was written using this information that calculated spectral performance with temperature as a parameter. An ambient calculation and a cryogenic calculation were performed where necessary for each component of interest. The translation between the two calculations was then measured and applied to the measured ambient data of the components to obtain their expected cryogenic performance.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Dietary Supplement Use and Beliefs among College Students Enrolled in an Introductory Nutrition Course</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Webb, Amy Denice</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to assess differences in the use of dietary supplements and beliefs related to their use based on college major, physical activity frequency, and weight status among college students enrolled in an introductory nutrition class. A secondary database consisting of introductory nutrition students at University of Tennessee, Knoxville during spring semester 2008 was used and contained a sample of 306 participants. Data were taken from results of a two part survey. The first section asked participants to respond about their use of dietary supplements and the second section asked participants to respond to their beliefs statements about supplements. Dietary supplements were assessed in 3 categories: vitamin and minerals, herbals, and ergogenic aids. Results showed that the most commonly used dietary supplements were vitamins and minerals with 228 (74.5%) of respondents reporting that they consumed at least 1 vitamin or mineral supplement in the last 12 months. While only 23 (7.5%) respondents reported using ergogenic aids, the use of this supplement category varied the most based upon major, weight status, and physical activity. Non-health-related majors (19.6% versus 9.0% of Health-related majors, p&lt;0.01), overweight and obese individuals (26.7% versus 8.2% of normal and underweight respondents, p&lt;0.001), and those who exercised daily (21.7% compared to 8.2% who exercised weekly or less, p&lt;0.001) were more likely to take them. Major played no role in health beliefs scores, but individuals that exercised daily and those who were overweight or obese had higher mean beliefs scores, showing stronger health beliefs related to dietary supplements. Use of ergogenic aids varied the most based upon study variables. Therefore, future research should focus on determining reasons for this.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Epistemological Axiology: What Is The Value Of Knowledge?</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Thompson, Eric Walter</dc:creator>
<dc:description>It is my overall aim in this work to defend the view that knowledge is no more valuable than true belief or empirically adequate belief, and thus is not the primary epistemic good. I engage predominately with Jonathan Kvanvig‟s work for an assessment of the value of knowledge. In turn, I assess the arguments for the value of knowledge for their ability to support the view that knowledge is uniquely valuable. First I will consider an argument which relies on a purported connection between knowledge and proper action. It will then be suggested that arguments tying knowledge to our proper action are not adequate to justify this standard view of the value of knowledge. Furthermore, I will assess an argument that appeals to the value of truth to explain the superior value of knowledge. From this it will be concluded that truth is also less valuable than typically thought, consequently resulting in an overvaluation of knowledge. Lastly, I will investigate the possibility that knowledge has its value because of its stability and resistance to irrationality. Again, I will argue that this is insufficient justification of the standard view about the value of knowledge by offering counterexamples to both the stability of knowledge and knowledge‟s resistance to irrationality. After this I will discuss the implications of my analysis on the value of knowledge.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Analyzing Poverty in the Southern United States</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Jung, Suhyun</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis deals with two related topics under the theme of ―Analyzing Poverty in the Southern United States‖. The first part explores the role of government healthcare and education expenditure for poverty reduction, focusing particularly on how these relationships change over space and time in the Southern United States. It is found that healthcare expenditure is a significant contributor to poverty alleviation in both 1990 and 2000. The healthcare expenditure has a relatively high poverty-reducing effect in the Texas cluster and in the west part of the Mississippi Delta cluster in both years, while the poverty-reducing effect of healthcare expenditures disappears in 2000 in the Central Appalachia cluster. The effect of government expenditures on education decreased over time in the west part of the Mississippi Delta cluster but the education expenditure began to have a poverty-reducing effect in the Central Appalachia cluster in 2000. The second part focuses on disentangling the relationship between urban sprawl and poverty in the Southern United States. Results show that an increase in urban sprawl, as measured by wildland-urban interface (WUI), is associated with an increase in the urban poverty rate. The positive interrelationship between urban poverty and area of sprawl in metro counties supports the theoretical framework that urban poverty is both cause and effect of urban sprawl. With no other direct or indirect association between the poverty rate and urban sprawl, the positive interrelationship is explained by the movement of business centers to the suburban areas by sprawl development and immobility of the poor and the middle and upper class households‘ preference for the neighborhoods with lower poverty rates.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An Automated Approach to the Study and Classification of Colliding and Interacting Galaxies</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Boada, Steven Alvaro</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Colliding galaxies are perhaps the greatest events changing and evolving our Universe. Consequently, the need for an understanding of how that interaction originated is very important. This thesis presents a framework in which the study of these events can be conducted in a timely and efficient manner. A genetic algorithm coupled with an initial conditions generator, a physics engine and an analysis package performs an automated search to visually match an unknown galactic interaction with a known event, thus providing the starting conditions that created such an interaction.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Affects of Clothing on Human Decomposition: Implications for Estimating Time Since Death</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Miller, Robyn Ann</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Several studies at the Anthropology Research Facility located at The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, longitudinally examine the process of human decomposition. However, to date, no study has focused exclusively on clothing as a variable in this process. Furthermore, few studies have been performed using animal models. Recent research demonstrates conflicting results regarding the affect of clothing on decomposition. Some authors conclude that clothing accelerates decomposition, while others maintain that it retards the process. The goal of this study is two fold: first, the process of decomposition of clothed human subjects was documented; second, it was determined whether clothing accelerates or retards the process of decomposition. This was accomplished by comparing temperature, i.e., accumulated degree-days, for clothed cadavers with those of nude cadavers.
Over the course of one year, the cadavers of six unembalmed, unautopsied individuals were dressed in clothing and placed at the Anthropology Research Facility to decompose naturally. Subjects were observed and scored on a decomposition staging scale of I to IV. Accumulated degree days were then calculated and compared against values obtained from previous research utilizing nude cadavers. It was determined that clothing retards the process of decomposition in the spring and summer. Clothing was not a significant variable in the winter and no comparison was possible for cadavers used in the fall.  This study demonstrates that the presence or absence of clothing must be appreciated and compensated for when making an estimate of time since death.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Conversion of Glycerol to Lactic Acid under Low Corrosive Conditions with Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Catalysts</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Chen, Lu</dc:creator>
<dc:description>With the increasing demand for biodiesel, the accumulation of byproduct, crude glycerol has become a problem which needs to be solved. Lactic acid is one of the value-added chemical which can be produced from glycerol that has wide uses in food and chemical industry. Although glycerol can be converted to lactic acid with an alkali as the catalyst at high glycerol conversion (100 mol%) and lactic acid yield (around 90 mol%), the high alkalinity would cause severe corrosiveness to a stainless steel reactor. In this study two tasks were performed to convert glycerol to lactic acid with satisfactory conversion and selectivity, and to reduce the corrosiveness of reaction medium.
First, CaO was used as solid base catalyst. The highest lactic acid yield achieved was 40.8 mol% with a 97.8 mol% glycerol conversion, when operating at 290°C after 150 min reaction with molar ratio of CaO: glycerol=0.3. Also CaO has advantages such as high lactic acid productivity (3.35 g/(min·L)) and reusability. Meanwhile, CaO can be used as the catalyst for both biodiesel production and the following crude glycerol conversion to lactic acid. Second, for glycerol conversion with NaOH as catalyst, a fed-batch reactor was applied to continuously supply NaOH during reaction process, compensating the OH- neutralized by newly formed lactic acid. The optimal lactic acid yield of 80.5 mol%, with 92.8% glycerol conversion was obtained at 300 °C for 220min, with 1.1 M glycerol initial concentration. A first-order kinetic model for glycerol concentration versus time was developed and verified experimentally under conditions with different initial glycerol concentration and reaction temperature. Although crude glycerol samples contained large amount of impurities, both methods, conversion with solid base catalyst and with fed-batch reactor, were applied successfully to three crude glycerol samples provided by biodiesel manufacturers, and the lactic acid yield reached 52.3 mol% and 72.7 mol% respectively.
Finally, the corrosion issue of different methods was compared based on the Fe3+ concentration (analyzed with atomic-absorption spectroscopy) in the products. Both methods of glycerol conversions, with solid base catalyst and fed-batch reactor, can reduce the corrosiveness of glycerol conversion with an alkali as the catalyst.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Liminal Space in Architecture: Threshold and Transition</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Zimmerman, Patrick Troy</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The limen is defined as the transitional threshold between two fixed states in cultural rites of passage or between two dissimilar spaces in architecture. The study of rites of passage provides an analogy from which principles can be drawn for the design of a transformative space. The characteristics that define liminal space include layering, dissolution, blurring, and ambiguity and have the ability to transform the occupant of that space as they move through it. The experience of liminal space poses a discontinuity and leads the occupant to question their surroundings, thus leading to heightened awareness of the space as a transformative threshold between distinct spaces.
The design of a ballpark, a building type associated with ritual, will be the vehicle for the exploration of the design of liminal space. Attention to the individual ritualistic acts of attending a ballgame can heighten the perception of the fan and their movement through a transitional space which transforms them from their everyday life. Additionally, a blurring of the space of the fan with the space of the player and a blurring of the space of the city and the space of the game will further heighten the ambiguity. Through an analysis of precedents that address both liminal space as transformative threshold and the liminality present in the ballpark, the design of the ballpark will create a transformative space for both the player and the fan which is based in history and advances the perception of the threshold as transformative.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An Infrastructure for the Analysis of Communication Patterns in Virtual Topologies</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bhatia, Nikhil</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The virtual topology of a parallel application is the neighborhood relationship between communicating processes developed due to specific communication patterns resulting from domain decomposition. We present an infrastructure that allows the usage of topological information for the performance analysis of a parallel application. For this purpose we have implemented an easy to use extension of the KOJAK performance analysis toolkit.
The KOJAK toolkit defines communication patterns for parallel applications which describe inefficient behavior. The performance analysis is carried out by calculating the effect of these inefficiency patterns on the application's performance. The distribution of these inefficiency patterns is studied across a three-dimensional performance space. The knowledge of virtual topology can be exploited to explain the occurrence of these inefficiency patterns in terms of higher-level events related to the parallel algorithm implemented in the application. Also, it can be used to visualize the relationships between pattern occurrences and the topological characteristics of the affected processes, To prove these principles, we have used our extensions to KOJAK to analyze two realistic MPI applications.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Streamflow Reconstructions in the Tennessee Valley Using Tree-Ring Chronologies</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ogle, Ross William</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Tennessee Valley surface water is important to economic and population growth in the southeastern United States.  By expanding streamflow records, water planners and managers can make decisions based on hydrologic events not appearing in current instrumental records.  In the following research, monthly flow data from six USGS streamflow gages on the Clinch, Emory, Holston, and Nolichucky Rivers is used to create seasonal and annual streamflow seasons.  Approximately 70 tree-ring chronologies across the Southeast U.S. are prescreened by length and correlation analysis against 38 streamflow seasons revealing that the May-June-July (MJJ) streamflow period displays the best tree-ring climate signal.  The screened chronologies are then entered into stepwise linear regression, and R2 values for the six models range from 0.36 to 0.52.  Reconstruction models range indicate estimation errors due to multicollinearity of the streamflow and tree-ring chronology datasets are minimal.  The Durbin-Watson statistics indicate the model residuals do not autocorrelate, except for the Nolichucky River streamflow model, which may possess serial correlation.  The positive values of the RE parameter indicate each of the models have statistical skill, and the RMSE parameter provides error ranges equal to 18 to 44% of the average observed instrumental flows.  Based on the results, three gages, the Nolichucky, NF Holston, and SF Holston, were deemed acceptable.  These models represent the first statistically skillful streamflow reconstructions in the Tennessee Valley.  The reconstructions range from 209 to 295 years in length ending in 1980 and extending as far back as 1686.  Examination of the reconstructions shows extreme drought in the 1770s. The wettest periods occurred from the 1970s to the mid-2000s.  Other severe drought events occurred in the 1700s, the 1840s, and the early 1910s proving current records do not provide full accounts of Tennessee Valley streamflow variability.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Airplane Piston Engine Dynamics as an Aeronca E-113 Case Study</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Leigh, Michael Charles</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Kinematic equations were developed to describe the dynamic motions of the aircraft piston engine components in terms of time dependent position, velocity, and acceleration relationships. Using the Aeronca E-113 engine as a case study, the brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) rating was used to model the cylinder gas pressure profile. The moments of inertia of the dynamic components including connecting rod, crankshaft, and propeller were measured using a pendulum swing method. Representative values were obtained for inertial and gas pressure forces acting on crankshaft journals, connecting rods, and cylinder walls. The resulting model can help in the design of crankshafts and other dynamically loaded parts to resist failure due to fatigue.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An Empirical Model of Thermal Updrafts Using Data Obtained From a Manned Glider</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Childress, Christopher E</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Various methods have been used, including airborne radars, LIDAR, observation of flying birds, towers, tethered balloons, and aircraft to gain both a qualitative and quantitative representation of how heat and moisture are transported to higher altitudes and grow the boundary or mixing layer by thermal updrafts.  This paper builds upon that research using an instrumented glider to determine the structure and build a mathematical model of thermals in a desert environment.  During these flights, it was discovered that the traditional view of a thermal as a singular rising plume of air did not sufficiently explain what was being observed, but rather another phenomenon was occurring.  This paper puts forth the argument and a mathematical model to show that thermals actually take the form of a hexagonal convection cell at higher levels in the convective boundary layer when the thermal acts as if unrestrained by borders as in non-linear cases of free convection.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An FPGA Based Implementation of the Exact Stochastic Simulation Algorithm</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Vanguri, Phani Bharadwaj</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Mathematical and statistical modeling of biological systems is a desired goal for many years. Many biochemical models are often evaluated using a deterministic approach, which uses differential equations to describe the chemical interactions. However, such an approach is inaccurate for small species populations as it neglects the discrete representation of population values, presents the possibility of negative populations, and does not represent the stochastic nature of biochemical systems. The Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) developed by Gillespie is able to properly account for these inherent noise fluctuations. Due to the stochastic nature of the Monte Carlo simulations, large numbers of simulations must be run in order to get accurate statistics for the species populations and reactions. However, the algorithm tends to be computationally heavy and leads to long simulation runtimes for large systems. Therefore, this thesis explores implementing the SSA on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to improve performance. Employing the Field programmable Gate Arrays exploits the parallelism present in the SSA, providing speedup over the software implementations that execute sequentially. In contrast to prior work that requires re-construction and re-synthesis of the design to simulate a new biochemical system, this work explores the use of reconfigurable hardware in implementing a generic biochemical simulator.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Terrain Impacts from Vehicle Operations across Multiple Passes</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kane, James Robert</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study, conducted on August 12th and 13th, 2008 at Fort Riley, Kansas on a clay loam soil, evaluated the terrain impacts of four commonly used tracked and wheeled military vehicles: the M1A1 Abrams Main Battle Tank, M998 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle, M985 Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck, and M113 Armored Personnel Carrier. Disturbed width and impact severity were assessed along 14 spirals subjected to a maximum of eight consecutive passes for a total of 696 impact points. Data indicate that multiple passes produce increased vegetative impacts, with multipass coefficients ranging from 0.98 to 4.44 (compared to the commonly accepted value of 2.00) depending on vehicle type and turn severity. The widely-used MPC of 2.00 fits the M985 HEMTT and M113 at sharp turns, with an MPC of 1.00 fitting the straight and intermediate turning conditions of these vehicles, as well as all turning conditions for the M998 HMMWV. For the M1A1, a MPC of 2.00 is suitable for straight paths, a MPC of 3.00 is suitable for intermediate turns, while sharp turns can be represented by a MPC of 4.00. The data suggests that MPCs should be adjusted depending on the vehicle type and according to the turning radius of the vehicle, as tracked vehicles were found to have a higher multipass coefficient than wheeled vehicles, with multipass coefficients increasing with vehicle weight and the sharpness of turns.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Increasing Dietary Linoleic Acid Does Not Increase Tissue Arachidonic Acid Content in Adults Consuming Western- Type Diets</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Rett, Brian</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Linoleic acid, with a DRI of 12-17g/d, is the most highly consumed polyunsaturated fatty acid in the Western diet and is found in virtually all commonly consumed foods.  The concern with dietary linoleic acid, being the metabolic precursor of arachidonic acid, is its consumption may enrich tissues with arachidonic acid and contribute to chronic and overproduction of bioactive eicosanoids. However, no systematic review of human trials regarding linoleic acid consumption and subsequent changes in tissue levels of arachidonic acid has been undertaken.  In this study, we reviewed the human literature that reported changes in dietary linoleic acid and its subsequent impact on changing tissue arachidonic acid in erythrocytes and plasma/serum phospholipids. We identified, reviewed, and evaluated all peer-reviewed published literature presenting data outlining changes in dietary linoleic acid in adult human clinical trials that reported changes in phospholipid fatty acid composition (specifically arachidonic acid) in plasma/serum and erythrocytes within the parameters of our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Decreasing dietary linoleic acid up to 90% was not significantly correlated with changes in tissue arachidonic acid levels (p=0.39). Similarly, when dietary linoleic acid levels were increased six fold, no significant correlations with tissue arachidonic acid levels were observed (p=0.72). However, there was a positive relationship between dietary gamma-linolenic acid and arachidonic acid on changes in tissue arachidonic levels. Our results do not support the concept that modifying current intakes of dietary linoleic acid has an effect on changing tissue levels of arachidonic acid in adults consuming Western-type diets.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Cavitation of Mercury in a Centrifugal Pump</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hooper, David Alan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Cavitation is a significant concern for the reliable operation of a centrifugal pump. Liquid metal flow loops are used in nuclear, chemical, metal forming, and liquid metal dynamo applications. Understanding of the cavitation characteristics of liquid metals is increasingly important to the design and operation of these facilities. One recent field of cavitation research has developed for mercury flow in spallation targets used in neutron sources. To further the understanding of mercury cavitation, a review of the existing literature on water cavitation, liquid metal cavitation, and mercury cavitation is performed. The mechanics of cavitation and the analytical methods applied to cavitation problems are discussed and analyzed. Acoustic data from the centrifugal pump for the mercury flow loop at the Spallation Neutron Source in Oak Ridge National Laboratory are examined.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Seasons for a Cynic: A Compositional Process Utilizable for a Program Symphony</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Pegel, David Anthony</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The technique of symphonic composition requires a deliberate and methodical process by the composer; when the symphony is intended to aesthetically convey a specific subject matter, the compositional process must become even more deliberate. First a subject must be chosen and examined in a contemporary standpoint. Then the composer must determine how to reflect this subject through his or her composing. Ideally, the end result of this composition should encompass the subject matter as thoroughly as possible.
While the great majority of textbooks on music theory and composition centralize themselves on elements of pitch in music, the composer has many other elements to consider, notably rhythm, texture, timbre, and form. These elements – be they working independently of one another, supporting one another, or at odds with one another – can be influenced by a wide variety of both traditional and developmental artistic movements. Oftentimes, a composer may find it ideal to synthesize both older techniques of one element with newer techniques in another.
This synthesis was the objective in composing a modern program symphony based on the four seasons. Emulating different styles and affects of the twentieth century, this work aimed to synthesize both older and newer techniques. This thesis explains in detail the compositional process used for this program symphony.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Single Molecule Detection of Near-Infrared Phthalocyanine Dyes</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Li, You</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The major advantage associated with near-infrared monitoring is the fact that few compounds show intrinsic fluorescence in this region of the spectrum and hence background from other molecules is reduced. Phthalocyanine dyes provide emission at deep red and near infrared wavelengths but have excellent photostability and hence are an attractive candidate for near-infrared fluorescence bioassay applications. However, because of their small Stokes shifts, non-standard methods are needed for optimum separation of fluorescence from scattered laser light. This thesis reports the development of a custom confocal microscope that uses a lowcost laser diode operating at 667 nm for sample excitation and an angle-tuned Raman notch filter to block scattered laser radiation and provide high-throughput of fluorescence with small Stokes shift. Also, a diffraction grating is used to isolate the laser excitation wavelength from the broadband luminescence of the laser. The experimental system is used to observe photon bursts from single molecules of zinc phthalocyanine fluorophores in an ethanol solution. The autocorrelation function of the photon trace, which is measured in fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, provides a measure of the presence of photon bursts from single molecules. Experiments to characterize the limits of detection of near-infrared fluorophores in aqueous solution using the microscope are also discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Status of Table Mountain Pine (&lt;em&gt;Pinus pungens&lt;/em&gt;) Stands on the Cherokee National Forest, Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Morgan, Amy Louise</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Table Mountain pine (Pinus pungens Lamb.)(TMP) is a threatened species, endemic to the southern Appalachian Mountains. The status of TMP following the southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis Zimmerman) outbreak of 1999–2001 is unknown. This study focuses on stands of the Cherokee National Forest (CNF) in eastern Tennessee that had a TMP component in the 1994 Continuous Inventory of Stand Condition (CISC) data. This project has two parts: an inventory of the 1994 stands as well as a case study of cost comparison of release treatments for a young overstocked stand. The objective of the inventory was to visit the TMP stands designated in the 1994 CISC data on the CNF to determine whether these stands still contain a significant component of TMP and to document the present stand condition and successional status. The objective of the case study was to produce a cost analysis/comparison of releasing young TMP that are in the stem exclusion stage of stand development by several silvicultural methods: strip thinning, crop tree release, and prescribed burning.  TMP is declining across the CNF with less that 900 acres dominated by the species. TMP was a major component on more than 7400 acres from the 1994 data, but many have also succeeded to hardwoods because of the absence of fire and SPB infestations. Management actions should be taken to maintain the health of remaining TMP stands on the CNF. Reintroduction of a controlled burning regime to create seedbed conditions favorable to TMP regeneration and to control hardwoods in existing stands is suggested. If TMP is to remain in Southern Appalachian ecosystems, more direct, cost-effective, and positive management approaches are necessary.  Initial cost effectiveness of release treatments were analyzed. Regardless of treatment, costs ranged from $18 to $45 per acre. In this study, prescribed burning, generally considered  more cost effective than mechanical treatments, was most expensive because of the small tract size and the labor involved to monitor the burn. The crop tree release treatment had the least cost because small trees were cut and cost of equipment is minimal</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Benefits of Integrating Math Content into the Elementary Art Curriculum</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sigmon, Valerie C</dc:creator>
<dc:description>School accountability has become critical under the No Child Left Behind Act. As struggling schools strive to reach mandated proficiency levels, is it possible for an art teacher to contribute toward students‟ success by integrating math content into art lessons? This study attempts to show that without schedule changes, additional funding, or added training, an art teacher can support the efforts of classroom teachers as evidenced by increased scores on standardized math tests. The research used a Non-Equivalent Groups Design and examined pre-test and post-test scores for two groups of students. The population for this study is 3,800 elementary school children who attend Project GRAD schools. The experimental group which received integrated instruction is a convenience sample. It is comprised of 360 students who attend the 3rd, 4th, and 5th grades at two of the Project GRAD schools. The control group is made up of 3,440 students who did not receive the experimental instruction. The test scores were analyzed using t-test for normal distribution of scores, and a confidence level of .05 was selected. The results of this research indicate positive results from integrating math content into the elementary art curriculum.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Design and Synthesis of a Boronic Acid Sensor to Study Carbohydrate Binding Using SERS</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Petersen, Paul Russell</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Carbohydrates are known to play a large number of significant roles in various biological and pathological processes such as cancer metastasis and cellular communication. This is because of their ability to bind a wide range of hosts within the human body such as proteins and viruses. Due to these important interactions, carbohydrate sensing has long been a main focus of research. These research strategies have included the use of aptamers, non-covalent interactions, and boronic acid-based receptors. Boronic acid-based sensors are of particular interest due to their selectivity for 1,2- or 1,3-diols. Within these boronic acid-based studies, a large variety of techniques were employed for detection including different fluorescent, electrochemical, polymeric, and colorimetric studies, as well as various surface bound sensors. One type of technique that has rarely been applied is Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy or SERS. This strategy would be beneficial as it provides information about functional groups, which would aid in the identification of the bound sugar. In this thesis, we present work based on the development of a boronic acid-based carbohydrate receptor that will be used to study carbohydrate binding through SERS. The receptor design includes an aryl boronic acid for carbohydrate recognition, a nitrogen atom in close proximity to the boron center to enhance binding, and a terminal thiol for attachment to a metal surface for SERS. This sensor will be used to study the binding of different saccharides for sensing applications.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Major and Trace-Element Chemistry of Minerals in Lithologies A and B in Martian Meteorite EETA79001: Petrogenesis Revisited</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Mellin, Michael Joseph</dc:creator>
<dc:description>EETA79001 is a unique shergottite composed of two mafic lithologies (termed LithA and LithB) that are separated by an igneous contact. Both lithologies have basaltic compositions; however, LithA contains megacrysts of olivine, orthopyroxenes, and chromite whereas LithB does not; also, LithA is finer-grained than LithB. Currently, the literature is in disagreement regarding the formation of this unique meteorite, especially regarding LithA. Different formational theories (e.g. fractional crystallization, magma mixing, assimilation, and impact melting) have their own constraints (chemical, thermal, or petrographic). This study uses petrographic observations combined with major- and trace- element compositions within minerals to investigate the petrogenesis of LithA. Previous formational theories are addressed and a new model is proposed.
The groundmass composition of LithA is important in explaining the relationship between megacrysts and the groundmass. Previous estimates do not consider weighted compositional averages or overgrowths on olivine megacrysts. In this study, a new estimate of the LithA groundmass composition is obtained using weighted averages of zoned minerals (major-element), and includes the overgrowth rims on megacrysts.
Here, I introduce a new LithA formational model that involves the mixing of cold megacrysts with magma. This hybrid model suggests that the interaction of the megacrysts and magma altered the heat balance and changed the crystallization sequence, as evidenced by the major-element trend in pyroxenes and the finer grain size of the LithA groundmass. The megacryst overgrowths and groundmass then crystallized, and was later followed by the removal of the late-stage fractionated melt (liquid ~Mg# 20). This new model would explain the formation of the overgrowths and avoids the heat constraints associated with magma mixing and assimilation. However, a short-coming of this theory lies in the necessity for the late-stage removal of the last ~10% of the melt, necessary to modify the original magma composition to that of the observed LithA groundmass composition.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Characterizing Strength and Fracture of Wood Micropillars Under Uniaxial Compression</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Zhang, Xinan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The structure of the actual wood cell wall is very complex and it consists of several layers. Some research has been done to measure the mechanical properties of wood cell wall. For example, the hardness and modulus of wood cell wall was estimated using a nanoindentation test. But the mechanical contribution of wood cell wall is not fully understood and documented in the literature. Understanding the micro mechanical properties of the wood cell wall are paramount because of the potential for applications in cellulose nano-composites research and development.
The focus of this research was to investigate the essential of the strength and fracture of wood cell walls by uniaxial micro-compression test. Keranji and loblolly pine were chosen to perform the micro-compression tests. After initial sample preparation by microtoming, a novel method for sample preparation was adopted. The cylindrical shaped micro pillars were milled using a Focused Ion Beam (FIB) while each pillar was milled in a single wood cell wall. The beam voltage of this FIB system was 30 KV. After measuring the dimension of the micropillar through analyzing the SEM images by ImageJ software, the uniaxial compression test on the micro pillar was conducted using a Nano II Indenter system with a 10 micrometers diameter flat tip. The loading rate of 20 nm/s was used to obtain the load-displacement curves. As a result, the yield stress of keranji cell wall was 136.5 MPa and the compression strength was 160 MPa. The yield stress of loblolly pine cell wall was 111.3 MPa and the compression strength was 125 iv MPa. The fracture behavior of wood micropillar confirmed that wood cell wall also is a brittle type of material.
KEY WORDS: wood, cell wall, loblolly pine, keranji, focused ion beam (FIB), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), micropillar, uniaxial micro-compression test, fracture behavior.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Evaluation of the Aerodynamics of an Aircraft Fuselage Pod Using Analytical, CFD, and Flight Testing Techniques</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Moonan, William C</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this study is to investigate the execution and validity of various predictive methods used in the design of the aerodynamic pod housing NASA’s Marshall Airborne Polarimetric Imaging Radiometer (MAPIR) on the University of Tennessee Space Institute’s Piper Navajo research aircraft. Potential flow theory and wing theory are both used to analytically predict the lift the MAPIR Pod would generate during flight; skin friction theory, empirical data, and induced drag theory are utilized to analytically predict the pod’s drag. Furthermore, a simplified computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was also created to approximate the aerodynamic forces acting on the pod. A limited flight test regime was executed to collect data on the actual aerodynamic effects of the MAPIR Pod. Comparison of the various aerodynamic predictions with the experimental results shows that the assumptions made for the analytic and CFD analyses are too simplistic; as a result, the predictions are not valid. These methods are not proven to be inherently flawed, however, and suggestions for future uses and improvements are thus offered.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>High Order Contingency Selection using Particle Swarm Optimization and Tabu Search</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Chegu, Ashwini</dc:creator>
<dc:description>There is a growing interest in investigating the high order contingency events that may result in large blackouts, which have been a great concern for power grid secure operation. The actual number of high order contingency is too huge for operators and planner to apply a brute-force enumerative analysis. This thesis presents a heuristic searching method based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and tabu search to select severe high order contingencies. The original PSO algorithm gives an intelligent strategy to search the feasible solution space, but tends to find the best solution only. The proposed method combines the original PSO with tabu search such that a number of top candidates will be identified. This fits the need of high order contingency screening, which can be eventually the input to many other more complicate security analyses.
Reordering of branches of test system based on severity of N-1 contingencies is applied as a pre-processing to increase the convergence properties and efficiency of the algorithm. With this reordering approach, many critical high order contingencies are located in a small area in the whole searching space. Therefore, the proposed algorithm tends to concentrate in searching this area such that the number of critical branch combinations searched will increase. Therefore, the speedup ratio is found to increase significantly.
The proposed algorithm is tested for N-2 and N-3 contingencies using two test systems modified from the IEEE 118-bus and 30-bus systems. Variation of inertia weight, learning factors, and number of particles is tested and the range of values more suitable for this specific algorithm is suggested.
Although illustrated and tested with N-2 and N-3 contingency analysis, the proposed algorithm can be extended to even higher order contingencies but visualization will be difficult because of the increase in the problem dimensions corresponding to the order of contingencies.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effects of Combinations of Cropping Sequences and Biocovers on Yield of Glyphosate-tolerant Corn, Soybean, and Cotton under No-till</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Noe, Jennifer Elizabeth</dc:creator>
<dc:description>No-till acreage is increasing in the United States as producers begin to recognize the environmental and economic benefits of this management system. Although the potential to receive carbon credits or payments for maintaining or initiating no-till may encourage producers to employ these practices, crop yields will be a factor in management decisions. Our objective was to examine the effects of combinations of cropping sequences and winter biocovers upon glyphosate-tolerant corn, cotton, and soybean yields under long-term no-tillage at two locations in Tennessee. Research was conducted during the first four-year phase (2002-2005) of a two-phase agronomic systems study (2002-2009) at the Research and Education Center at Milan (RECM) in Milan, Tennessee, and the Middle Tennessee Research and Education Center (MTREC) in Spring Hill, Tennessee. The experiment was a randomized complete block design with split block treatments, with the main plots consisting of 13 different cropping sequences of corn, cotton, and soybean at RECM and eight different cropping sequences of corn and soybean at MTREC. The subplots consisted of hairy vetch, wheat, poultry litter and fallow biocovers applied perpendicular to the sequences. Rotated corn and soybean yields were comparable to or higher than their respective monoculture sequences at both locations. At RECM, cotton yields took longer to respond to rotation as rotated cotton yields only outperformed continuous cotton in the final year. At both sites, corn and soybean yields were highest under fallow and poultry litter biocovers, respectively. Cotton yields were highest under poultry litter at RECM. Interaction effects of cropping sequence x biocovers were inconsistent as interaction effects were only observed on corn yields at MTREC in 2004 and 2005. Hairy vetch, wheat, and poultry increased yields when changing from continuous corn to rotated corn. The presence of some cropping sequence x biocover interaction effects is encouraging and perhaps suggests a longer time period may be needed for the combined effects of crop sequence and biocovers upon crop yields to become apparent. Results from the next four years of the experiment will provide more information on the long-term effects of crop sequence and biocovers on corn, soybean, and cotton yields.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Tectonometamorphic Evolution of the Eastern Blue Ridge: Differentiating Multiple Paleozoic Orogenic Pulses in the Glenville and Big Ridge Quadrangles, Southwestern North Carolina</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Stahr, Donald W</dc:creator>
<dc:description>New field and analytical data collected in the eastern Blue Ridge (EBR) of southwestern North Carolina reveal a complex, polyphase thermotectonic history, and delimit the timing of previously unrecognized orogenic pulses in a portion of the southern Appalachian orogenic core. Detailed geologic mapping of the Glenville and Big Ridge 7.5’ quadrangles delineated the location of the Chattahoochee fault, a tectonic boundary separating the western Tugaloo terrane from distinct central Blue Ridge terranes.
Zircon geochronologic data for two EBR granitoids in the map area indicate emplacement occurred at ~335 Ma, making these plutons among the youngest recognized in the EBR. Bulk-rock geochemical analyses of the Walnut Creek pluton reveal similarities with the Whiteside Granite, and strongly suggest similar source regions for Ordovician and Mississippian trondhjemitic magmas. Field relationships and Al-in-hornblende barometry suggest intrusion into mid-crustal levels (~7 kbar) pre- to synkinematic with regional D3 deformation.
Host rock porphyroblast textures and microstructures indicate distinct tectonometamorphic histories for Cartoogechaye and Tugaloo terrane samples, providing support for distinct P–T–t–D paths. Cartoogechaye terrane samples reached significantly higher temperatures and pressures during Taconian orogenesis. Mineral assemblages and textures suggest pressures &gt;9 kbar(?), and peak sillimanite II zone temperatures (≥750 ºC).
Tugaloo terrane samples in the southern Big Ridge quadrangle preserve pristine Taconian M2 mineral assemblages. Multi-equilibrium calculations using balanced, linearly independent reactions performed on a metapelite yielded near-peak metamorphic conditions of 703 ± 30 ºC and 9.0 ± 1.2 kbar (2 sigma). These conditions accompanied intrusion of the Ordovician Whiteside Granite.
A distinct thermal overprint is evident from metapelite samples collected ≤1 km from the Mississippian Rabun and Walnut Creek plutons. Evidence consists of psuedomorphs of muscovite ± sillimanite after staurolite at distances &lt;0.5 km from the intrusions, and post-kinematic staurolite + kyanite porphyroblasts that cross cut all fabric at distances of ≤1 km.  Plagioclase deformation mechanisms interpreted to have accommodated strain during shearing along the Chattahoochee fault include climb-accommodated dislocation glide and grain-boundary migration recrystallization. These microstructures are consistent with deformation temperatures &gt;600 ºC. Geochemical signatures, xenocrystic zircons, and high–T shearing together strongly suggest Ordovician juxtaposition of the Tugaloo and central Blue Ridge terranes.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Schneider, David John</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Selective epigenetic control of the cellular machinery is a grail of drug development. The balance between HAT’s and HDAC’s activities is one way the cell controls what, and at when during the cellular lifecycle a gene is expressed. Having the ability to lock chromatin down to the histone is a powerful tool for the treatment of disease states like cancer. Presented here is a preliminary exploration of the synthesis, and basic testing of novel compounds that use a triazole motif as a zinc binding group in an attempt to gain further selectivity in inhibition over HDAC’s.
Interest in the development of organic ligands to promote a metals activity as a catalyst is a broad, important field within organic chemistry. The synthesis of select bidentate 1,2,4-triazole- based ligands was carried out with the intent to study and to direct their catalytic activities once bound to a transition-metal center.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Sound Scenes: Performativity, Politics, and Capital in New Music Ensembles</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Pippen, John Robison</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis examines classical music as a cultural practice and centers on my ethnographies of three musical ensembles in the United States: Alarm Will Sound, eighth blackbird, and Yarn/Wire. Each group is a non-profit performing arts organization formed by conservatory-trained members and each performs and promotes new classical music, or &quot;new music&quot; as it is commonly called. I draw also on my own experience performing and interacting in new music communities.
From these mixed domains, I demonstrate new music ensembles as dynamic and complex entities in which individuals negotiate between the elitist conventions of classical music and populist ideals. In particular, I argue that aesthetic differences correspond to political struggles for recognition. Groups perform musical works in certain styles that reflect their respective aesthetics.  With such activities, new music ensembles endeavor to make a name for themselves and gain prominence in new music culture. They thus embody a struggle for prestige. The mechanism for these pursuits entails a circulation of symbolic capital and its conversion into real capital. I frame the activities of the three ensembles within an established history of practice and examine the documented tensions between classical composers and commercial musics, and between internal struggles of modernist and postmodern composers and performers. Finally, I problematize evolutionary concepts of modern and postmodern by portraying the older groups, Alarm Will Sound and eighth blackbird as postmodern, and the younger group, Yarn/Wire, as comparatively modernist.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Resonant Ultrasound Studies of Quasi-2D Na&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;CoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Cagle, Timothy Allen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Sodium cobaltate possesses all the important traits needed in a material for potential thermoelectric applications yet it shows little regard for the traditional physics of thermoelectrics. As existing theories regarding the phenomenon in NaxCoO2 are incomplete, we have set out to elucidate some of the issues by looking into the elastic response of the system. To this effect, we have employed Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy to obtain the elastic tensor at various temperatures. As the Na0.75CoO2 stoichiometry seemed to potentially offer the most rewards due to a pronounced ground state and anomalous thermopower at higher temperatures, this composition was chosen for study. Polycrystal samples and floating zone grown single crystal samples were studied in temperatures ranging from 5K to 300K and in various magnetic fields from 0T to 5T.
Elastic tensors were obtained for various samples whereas the absolute values of the moduli show insufficient agreement to be conclusive. The temperature dependence however is very consistent and displays two regions of interest (30K-60K temperature range and 250K- 300K range). In both regions, the material appears to stiffen with increasing temperature before relaxing back to its lower initial state. Anomalous activities at these temperatures have not been observed by most existing studies, thus have not been the subject of much discussion to date. As neither our data nor that of thermal conductivity measurements has displayed any signs of the 22K low temperature transition observed by magnetic and electronic transport measurements, it is our belief that the transition into the low temperature ground state is characterized by a rather weak coupling between phonons and the charge carriers that drive the transition. The natures of the high and low temperature anomalies are currently unclear.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Garden of Eden and &lt;em&gt;The Garden of Eden&lt;/em&gt;: Edenic Imagery in Ernest Hemingway's &lt;em&gt;The Garden of Eden&lt;/em&gt;</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lowe, Kelly Fisher</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis attempts to prove that there is a definite link between Ernest Hemingway's last novel The Garden of Eden and the biblical Eden narrative of Genesis 2-3. Through the use of both the novel and the Bible, and many secondary pieces of scholarship, both critical and biographical, the thesis demonstrates a substantial connection between Hemingway's work and the larger issue of religion.
The thesis is arranged in three parts. The study starts with the very general and grows more specific as it progresses.
Chapter 1 is a study of Hemingway's religious history. Through the use of available biographical information, I analyze Hemingway's various religious stances throughout his life and other significant biographical events.
The second chapter starts with a discussion of what exactly is meant by the phrase &quot;biblical Eden narrative.&quot; The chapter then discusses some of the Edenic imagery and themes in Hemingway's other work, especially the short stories and the novel The Sun Also Rises.
Chapter 3 then attempts to tie these two themes together. The chapter takes the established archetype and Hemingway's biography, and applies itself to a close reading of The Garden of Eden, discovering along the way, that Hemingway in fact had a great deal to say about reIigion and his relationship to it. More specifically, the thesis looks at the concepts of Adam and Eve in the Garden before and after the invasion of the serpent, the significance of the eating of the apple from the tree of knowledge and what is gained (knowledge) and what is lost (innocence).</dc:description>

			<dc:title>High Resolution X-ray Tomography of Fiber Reinforced Polymeric Composites</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Young, Stephen Andrew</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A high resolution x-ray tomography system was used to study chopped fiber polymeric composites made of polypropylene resin, nickel coated carbon fiber and Eglass fiber. Procedures are developed to obtain micro-structured features of importance. In-situ tensile testing system was developed and integrated into the existing hardware for tomography equipment to study the evolution of damage and micro-structural features as a function of mechanical stress. High resolution x-ray tomographic images of glass fiber were collected and viewed on a micron scale. The radiographs were reconstructed to visualize the fiber content of the samples in three dimensional volume. In addition, glass fiber dogbone specimens were tested on a miniature tensile machine using x-ray tomography to view deformation of the samples in high resolution. Fractures in the chopped glass composite were observed for x-ray microscopy showing the dominant failure mechanism of the sample are low interfacial strength and adhesion between the fiber and matrix. Cracks were not observed until after failure by fiber pull-out using the digital microscopy method. Using SEM microscopy method, resin cracking and fiber debonding was observed for a carbon fiber with vinyl ester resin while under tensile loading. Important micro-structural information relationship with and mechanical behavior including variation modulus, yield and ultimate strength are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>On cyclotomic primality tests</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Boucher, Thomas Francis</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In 1980, L. Adleman, C. Pomerance, and R. Rumely invented the first cyclotomicprimality test, and shortly after, in 1981, a simplified and more efficient versionwas presented by H.W. Lenstra for the Bourbaki Seminar. Later, in 2008, ReneSchoof presented an updated version of Lenstra's primality test. This thesis presents adetailed description of the cyclotomic primality test as described by Schoof, along withsuggestions for implementation. The cornerstone of the test is a prime congruencerelation similar to Fermat's \little theorem&quot; that involves Gauss or Jacobi sumscalculated over cyclotomic fields. The algorithm runs in very nearly polynomial time.This primality test is currently one of the most computationally efficient tests and isused by default for primality proving by the open source mathematics systems Sageand PARI/GP. It can quickly test numbers with thousands of decimal digits.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Comparison of Methods Simulating the Ankle Sprain Mechanism:Inversion Drop Test and Landing on a Slanted Surface</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Chen, Qingjian</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purposes of this study were to investigate the kinematics of two ankle brace testing protocols. They were drop landing on a slanted surface and the inversion drop test. Difference in kinematics and ground reaction forces of drop landing wearing an ankle brace on flat and lateral slant surfaces were also investigated. Eleven healthy subjects performed five trials in each of six dynamic movement conditions. They were an ankle inversion drop test on the inversion platform, drop landing from 0.45 m onto slant surface, and drop landing from 0.45 m onto flat surface with and without an ankle brace. A 7-camera motion analysis system was used to obtain the threedimensional kinematics. In addition, a force platform was used to measure the ground reaction forces (GRF) during drop landing. A 2 × 2 (brace × movement) repeated measures ANOVA was used to evaluate selected variables for inversion drop test and landing on slant surface (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, the differences between landing on the flat and slant surfaces were examined using a 2 × 2 (brace × surface) repeated measures ANOVA. The results showed that the slant surface landing resulted in significantly earlier maximum inversion angle occurrence. Significantly higher maximum eversion and inversion velocities were also found in the slant surface landing compared to the inversion drop. In the comparison of landing on the slant surface and flat surfaces, the results showed that slant surface landing led to smaller 1stand 2ndpeak vertical and horizontal GRFs, greater maximum inversion and its range of motion (ROM), and smaller dorsiflexion ROM. The results suggest that the slant surface landing simulate ankle sprain mechanism better than the inversion drop test. Subjects adopted a softer landing strategy when landing onto the flat surface and a stiffer strategy when landing onto the slanted surface.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Shadow State and Refugees: The Role of Nonprofit Organizations in Refugee Participation</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Judkins, Austin Penrod</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The devolution of welfare services in the United States has increased the importance of the nonprofit sector.  Geiger and Wolch argue that decentralization has left nonprofit organizations (NPOs) under the purview of the state.  They refer to this as the “shadow state.” Trudeau argues for a more nuanced view of the shadow state in which governmental agencies and NPOs are highly interdependent.  This research expands on the findings of Trudeau by extending the shadow state construct to the individual.  I examine the role of refugees in the shadow state construct and their ability to affect government policy through participation in NPOs and find that refugees do indeed play a role in the shadow state.  Through feedback, experience and, most importantly, by becoming part of the organization, refugees can have an impact on refugee services through participation in NPOs.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Blast Resistant Design of Steel Structures</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Janney, Sarah Beth</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to examine the load experienced by a steel blast cubicle from a surface blast test. An important objective was to determine the blast load experienced at different standoff distances and the blast resistance capability of the blast cubicle. Three cubicles with standoff distances of 20, 25, and 30ft respectively were simultaneously subjected to a 50lb TNT explosive. The manual Structures to Resist the Effects of Accidental Explosions, Army TM 5-1300 conservatively predicted the blast pressure loadings obtained from the pressure transducers mounted on the cubicles. Data collected from accelerometers was compared to results from the analysis program SDOF.
The cubicle walls exhibited elastic behavior without any visible permanent deformation. The wall facing the blast was found to experience the greatest loading and was the critical member. The roof, however, experienced substantial deformation. As the standoff distance from the blast increased the pressure loading experienced by the cubicles decreased. The cubicle closest to the blast was likely close to its limit. Thus the structural design of the blast cubicle was efficient and economical without waste of construction material.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Minimum Transmission Power Configuration in Real-Time Wireless Sensor Networks</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wang, Xiaodong</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Multi-channel communications can effectively reduce channel competition and interferences in a wireless sensor network, and thus achieve increased throughput and improved end-to-end delay guarantees with reduced power consumption. However, existing work relies only on a small number of orthogonal channels, resulting in degraded performance when a large number of data flows need to be transmitted on different channels. In this thesis, empirical studies are conducted to investigate the interferences among overlapping channels. The results show that overlapping channels can also be utilized for improved real-time performance if the node transmission power is carefully configured. In order to minimize the overall power consumption of a network with multiple data flows under end-to-end delay constraints, a constrained optimization problem is formulated to configure the transmission power level for every node and assign overlapping channels to different data flows. Since the optimization problem has an exponential computational complexity, a heuristic algorithm designed based on Simulated Annealing is then presented to find a suboptimal solution. The extensive empirical results on a 25-mote testbed demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves better real-time performance and less power consumption than two baselines including a scheme using only orthogonal channels.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An Architecture of Amelioration</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Plagemann, Geoffrey Russell</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Scar:  A lingering sign of damage or injury, either mental or physical.
Technological advancement scars the landscape.  It has been our practice to ignore, or worse, hide these marks that have been made as society continues to advance.  Industries past left us relics and ruins of bygone eras of promise and production.  The time we live in has recognized the untenable failures of past generations, however there are methods of industry that continue to injure the landscape.  We will leave our scars.
In this time we must rethink the scar, define it, and recognize its beauty.  The first step of reclamation is acquiring awareness of where the scar came from.  Whether it is an injury, an accident, or a natural disaster, some traumatic event caused lasting damage.  Traumatic events whether natural - hurricanes, floods and earthquakes - or manmade - wars, genocide and assaults - can cause both physical and emotional scars.  Human tissues can repair themselves leaving scars, but there are also the scars of repair.  Even technological advancements in medicine cannot eliminate the scar.  Scarring is the natural healing process, yet we view them as unnatural.
Once recognized, we must accept the scar so that we do not destroy it.  We must accept the traumatic cause/effect relationships, and be conscious of the healing process.  The scar must be appreciated:  the time that it takes to make it, the time that it takes to heal, the history it can teach, and the story that it can tell.  To hide it would only be an injustice to those who came before us and to those yet to come.  With acceptance a scar’s beauty can be seen.
Every new era of technology, every successive generation, leaves a scar.  The opportunity to aid the greatest healer – time – is now.  Every scar tells a story.
Reclamation:  A restoration, as to productivity, usefulness, or morality.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Predicting Forgiveness in Women Experiencing Intimate Partner Violence</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Gilbert, Sarah Elizabeth</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Several theories have attempted to explain the stay/leave decisions of women experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV). One recent study suggests that women’s intent to return to their abusive partners was related to forgiveness of the abuse; consequently, this study aims to identify factors that may make women more likely to forgive IPV. It was hypothesized that commitment, specifically both personal dedication and constraint commitment (Stanley &amp; Markman, 1992), would predict forgiveness and that denial of injury would mediate the relation between commitment and forgiveness, as women may be more likely to deny the severity of the abuse in order to reduce the experienced dissonance that arises from being committed to an unhealthy relationship. Finally, it was hypothesized that silencing the self (Jack, 1991) would moderate the relation between personal dedication and denial of injury. Results generally supported the hypothesis that denial of injury would mediate the relation between commitment and forgiveness. Silencing the self was not found to be a moderator.  These findings, limitations, and future directions are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Rooted in Place: The Role of Design in Small Town Identity</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sparks, Todd Owen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>@font-face {   font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; }p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; }table.MsoNormalTable { font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; }div.Section1 { page: Section1; }
Longstanding critical theories on place, memory, and identity can begin to address critical questions that residents, civic leaders, and designers are currently facing in twenty-first century small town America. The rapidity with which many rural communities are now transforming is unlike any previous phase of transition; due in large part to a vastly expanding globalized economy and mass culture. Anonymous, exchangeable environments are quickly becoming a standard condition for these cities, without much attention being paid by neither insiders nor outsiders alike. Often compounding the problem, poor existing social conditions within the aforementioned communities are not only being habitually unattended to, they are exacerbated by the parallel eradication of place. Due to these implications, a new direction in the modernization of rural communities across the nation is required to productively and responsibly plan for their future. A critical look at the roles of memory, place, and the built environment in the formation of collective and individual identities may be an integral step towards steering small towns down this path.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>INHABITING THE PERIPHERY: a dialogue between individual and site</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kown, Robert Oliver</dc:creator>
<dc:description>What is  a periphery? We can think about this word in more than one way. First off, peripheries are places that exist as spatial conditions in cities, They indicate edges and places that have been left behind. Spaces that have lost their meaning. But in this thesis I will use the word in another way as well. What does the periphery mean for us today? What are those parts of our lives that have been marginalized, and how can we begin to reclaim what has been lost? It is the aim of this thesis to address these issues of the individual in a site that exists on the edge of Manhattan--a place physically separated from the city by means of a highway, and in so doing, redeem both a physical space as well as a place within ourselves.
    One way in which we as a society create this edge condition within ourselves centers around how we structure our time. How do we work? When do we work? And, conversely, when do we rest? An important part of our twenty-first century lives centers around our ability to be in constant communication. Recent advancements in communication technology are fast shaping the way in which we live, and, as a result, we have constructed a world in which productivity and communication are no longer limited by our physical place. For its many benefits, one problem created by this is that of a population simultaneously connected to the world, yet easily disconnected from their physical place. When do we turn off? And, more importantly, what are we missing by being so endlessly connected?
    In response to this situation, I feel that we as a society need moments of repose to restore balance in our lives. It is during these breaks in our day that we are better able to synthesize information, form memory and maintain balance between engagement and rest. By connecting our minds with our bodies, moments of repose serve as physical and mental experiences that ground us in place.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Life and Death of an American Block: A Dialogue with Entropy</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Antanaitis, Micah Daniel</dc:creator>
<dc:description>My goal in this thesis is to frame, through design, an existing environment in a manner that fosters the witness and embrace of the reality and beauty of decay—which acts as a marker of the passage of time. My intent is to engage in a careful renewal of a neglected, and largely forgotten, urban landscape, which does not ignore its temporal context. My hope is to explore the full potential of the life cycle of buildings and discover the lesson of mortality in modern American ruins.Things fall apart. This is a simple truth about the physical world that humanity inhabits, which surrounds, invades and defines the human condition. Because [or in spite] of this we live in a culture that values progress, newness, and speed, that proselytizes through marketing the belief that comfort can be found in surrounding oneself with new things, pushing reminders of death away. The current world of architecture and design nurtures this mentality, selling projects through the production of sleek renderings of pristine and clean objects, a state that will only last for a short time. I argue that, in spite of this mind-set, the realization of entropic inevitability is necessary to provide a healthy temporal context through which to view daily life. Its acceptance is crucial to an appropriate perspective on life and the human condition, allowing positive forward movement in the midst of the change and deterioration that define life. I hope to show how architecture can foster this acceptance through adaptive re-use which values and interacts with the marks of time and traces of past use. The question that I am positing ultimately is this: How can new architecture breathe life into neglected spaces while also preserving the found beauty of the state of its breakdown, what one might call its ‘character’? Can architecture take cues from and be molded and enlivened by the people, events and nature that it interacts with and is transformed by? Can architecture enact a resurrection that deftly navigates between outright neglect and sterile renovation? And what is the appropriate way to do this?</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Detection of Stress Corrosion Cracking in Natural Gas Pipelines Using Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducers</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Albright, Austin P</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis describes the refinement of a non-destructive, in-line inspection system sensor for the detection of stress corrosion cracks (SCCs) in natural gas pipelines. The sensors are prototype electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) for noncontact ultrasonic inspection. The focus areas discussed involve the statistically validated performance improvements achieved through the addition of 12 more features, the addition of Principal Component Analysis plus Linear Discriminant Analysis (PCA+LDA) to the classification algorithm, and most significantly the creating of a training set. The training set allowed PCA+LDA to be included in the classification algorithm, as well as allowing one set of no-flaw signature features, one PCA projection matrix, and one LDA projection matrix to be used on multiple pipes and on multiple scanned paths from a pipe. A discrete wavelet decomposition is used to separate the frequency content of each EMAT sample (signature) into five distinct bands. From these decomposed signatures, features are extracted for classification. The classification begins with the projection of the features using the PCA projection matrix derived from the training set, immediately followed by the projection of the PCA projected features using the LDA projection matrix that was also derived from the training set. Finally, the PCA+LDA projected features are classified based on their Mahalanobis distances from the PCA+LDA projected no-flaw training set features. Using the improved feature set and this classification procedure, SCC identification improved 14% and there was an 80% reduction in the number of false positives. In addition, there was a 30% improvement in the detection of the most critical SCCs. SCCs whose average through wall depths were between 35% and 54%.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Control of Glyphosate Resistant Horseweed (Conyza canadensis) with Saflufenacil and Tank-Mixture Partners.</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Waggoner, Brock Steven</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Field and labratory studies were conducted to determine the efficacy of saflufenacil alone and with mixture partners for burndown. Field studies were conducted in 2009 and 2010 to evaluate saflufenacil in mixtures with glyphosate, glufosinate, or paraquat for control of glyphosate-resistant (GR) horseweed prior to planting cotton. Saflufenacil and saflufenacil mixtures were applied 7 days before planting (DBP). Saflufenacil at 25 and 50 g ai ha-1 in mixture with all three non-selective herbicides provided similar GR horseweed control when compared to the current standard of glyphosate plus dicamba. Control of GR horseweed was also not different at the 25 and 50 g ai ha-1 of saflufenacil across all mixtures from the standard of glyphosate plus dicamba.
Laboratory studies were initiated to determine the uptake and translocation of saflufenacil alone and when mixed with glyphosate and paraquat. It was found that glyphosate plus saflufenacil had a greater absorption of saflufenacil at 2 and 8 HAT. By 24 HAT there were not any differences between the amount of saflufenacil absorbed into GR horseweed between treatments. Translocation data also confirmed that the majority of saflufenacil stayed in the treated leaf at 72 HAT.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Effects of Land-Use Change on the Hydrological Properties of Andisols in the Ecuadorian Paramo</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hartsig, James Joseph</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The Ecuadorian páramo is characterized by unique soil properties that allow the ground to hold large amounts of water. These páramo grasslands support Andean cities and communities as a source of water for municipal, industrial, and agricultural use. Although recent research has suggested that changes in land use can decrease the amount of water and affect the water-holding capabilities of the soil, the hydrologic effects of different land uses, including burning for livestock grazing and pine planting for carbon credits, are currently under debate.
This research tested hypotheses about moisture-related properties of páramo soils under different land uses at two study areas in Ecuador. Bulk density, volumetric water content, water retention, and general physical properties were identified and compared between sites at those study areas. Soil structure differed between pine sites and other sites at both study areas, and moisture consistency differed between pine and other sites at the Mazar Wildlife Reserve. Volumetric water content values were high (mean of 86% at one Mazar site) but the pine sites contained less water by volume than the other sites. Water retention data showed that the surface horizons of all sites at both study areas require more pressure to release moisture than the subsurface horizons. Compared to other sites studied, the pine sites from both study areas have lower gravimetric water contents at saturation through -6.0 kPa. Different burning regimes do not appear to affect soil properties, in-situ moisture content, or water-retention capacity.
The introduction of pine plantations in the páramo at both study areas appears to have lowered soil moisture contents and reduced bulk density in the soil profile. This research adds to a growing group of studies that show that changes in land management can affect the hydrological properties of soils.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Corporate, Political, and Academic Perspectives on Tennessee Higher Education Accountability Policy</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Morse, Andrew Quentin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purposes of the research are (1) to identify the similarities and differences among corporate, political, and academic leaders in Tennessee on postsecondary education accountability policy and (2) to investigate ways for improving accountability policy as evidenced by the various stakeholders. The two following research questions will be adapted from the larger, ongoing study by Bogue et al. (2009) on accountability:
·        What differences and similarities exist among corporate, political, and academic stakeholders on the issues of collegiate mission and issues of accountability definition and evidence?
·        What are the most important steps that institutions of higher education can take to improve performance accountability and what factors impede effective accountability?
The study employed a quantitative survey design where academic,  corporate, and political leaders from Tennessee were investigated to identify differences and similarities on the purpose and function of  accountability policy within the state. The findings suggest that while there are numerous points of difference among the stakeholders, it isreasonable to conclude that the numerous similarities that exist can help guide the successful development of meaningful accountability policy.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Value Prior to Processing of Oriented Strand Board Flakes Through Hot Water Extraction</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sattler, Clinton T</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Research has already shown that the extraction of a valuable hemicellulose-rich stream is a viable option for revenue generation in the pulp and paper industries. Applying the value prior to pulping concept to the composite panel industry is a natural extension. If a hemicellulose extraction is accomplished under the right conditions, a non-trivial amount of fine chemicals can be generated, while leaving the woody substrate structurally intact for production to traditional products, such as oriented strand board (OSB). According to literature, the removal of hemicellulose can increase the dimensional stability while decreasing the degradability of OSB panels. This research studied the effects of hemicellulose removal by hot water extraction on softwood OSB wood flakes. Three reaction hold temperatures (120, 140, 160 deg C) and three isothermal hold times (20, 40, 60 min) were investigated. This research focuses on the changes that occurred in the physical and chemical properties of the wood flakes after extraction at each condition, while characterizing and classifying changes that occur in the liquid phase hydrolysates. Results indicated the extraction of hemicellulose in quantifiable levels begins at 120 deg. C and 40 mins and cellulose extraction begins at 140 deg C, 40 mins. The level of extraction of lignocellulosic materials, the decrease of wood flake thickness, and the acidity of the recovered hydrolysates all increase with an increase in extraction severity. The most promising results in regards to industrial implementation of OSB flake extraction occur at an extraction temperature of 140 deg C and 20 mins, coupled with hydrolysate conversion to high value chemicals.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>F/A-18A-D Hornet Current and Future Utilization of Mode I Automatic Carrier Landings</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Schrum, Brian T</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose for writing this thesis is to prove the automatic carrier landing system (ACLS) a valuable Operational Risk Management (ORM) tool for recovering F/A-18A-D aircraft aboard the modern aircraft carrier. ORM is itself a subset of human factors and worthy of exploration in the aviation systems field. In proving the value of the ACLS, the author presents the following objectives: 1) describe the major components of the F/A-18A-D and modern aircraft carrier ACLS, 2) describe the current Mode I approach procedures, and the Precision Approach Landing Systems (PALS) certification process, 3) promote an increase in automatic landings during night time and low ceiling/visibility environments through an analysis of ACLS strengths and weaknesses, and 4) advocate the continued use of fully automatic carrier landings amidst addressing deeply rooted fleet squadron paradigms and the advent of future technologies.
The information gathered for this thesis came primarily from the author’s own direct flight and test experiences as well as documentation of standardized Navy flight and test publications. Detailed background information on the ACLS and future landing programs along with data from the Naval Safety Center and the VX-23 Carrier Suitability department were used as evidence to support the findings.
The author concludes that the Mode I ACLS capability is extremely vital to the safe and expeditious recovery of the F/A-18A-D Hornet aircraft onboard the modern aircraft carrier that the Mode I automatic carrier landing system as currently structured and utilized is a highly effective risk management tool for naval aviation. The routine testing and certification of the precision approach equipment, all-weather capability, redundant cockpit data and voice safety network, plus enhanced aircraft carrier mobility through the use of Mode I approaches are all strengths of the ACLS system.
To enhance the effectiveness of the ACLS for future carrier operations, the author recommends: 1) creating RAG and fleet squadron command climates that promote and support the use of Mode I approaches, 2) increasing ACLS training for aircrew and maintainers, and 3) establishing a new CV-1 approach that can capitalize on JPALS functionality in order to improve upon automatic landings.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>AUTOMATING THE DATA REDUCTION PROCESS FOR MORE EFFICIENT FLIGHT TESTS AND REDUCING THE TIME FROM DAYS TO HOURS</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Young, Joseph Kenneth</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The University of Tennessee Space Institute’s (UTSI) active airborne science program often requires extensive modification to its fleet of aircraft in order to meet mission and customer requirements. These modifications can alter the flight characteristics of the aircraft. In order to determine if the aircraft is safe to fly after modification and to find any new flight characteristics resulting from the modifications, the flight test engineer (FTE) must plan and conduct limited flight testing on the aircraft and evaluate the resulting data to ensure safety of flight. The more efficient the data reduction and analysis process the quicker the aircraft can be released to the customer for flight operations. Flight-Data Analysis and RePorting System (F-DARPS) was developed in an attempt to decrease the time spent reducing data by automating the entire data reduction process. F-DARPS searches through a data file, determines when the aircraft is in a trim state, processes the data, and presents a limited number of performance and stability and control (S&amp;C) parameters to the FTE in a meaningful manner. Because F-DARPS is in an early stage of development, the system requirements, architecture, code techniques, and a self case study with future revision recommendations will be discussed in detail.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Evaluation of Capital Investment and Cash Flows for Alternative Switchgrass Feedstock Supply Chain Configurations</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Chen, Jie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Biofuels have been widely recognized as a potential renewable energy source, and the United States’ government has been interested in producing ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass such as switchgrass. To evaluate whether lignocellulosic biomass based biofuels production is economically feasible, this paper estimated the capital investment outlays, operation costs, and net present value for investment in alternative switchgrass feedstock supply chain configurations in East Tennessee a 25 million gallon per year ethanol biorefinery. Two scenarios are analyzed in the study. The conventional hay harvest scenario includes the production, harvest, storage and transportation of biomass feedstocks from the fields to the biorefinery. The preprocessing scenario added preprocessing facilities into the biomass supply chain. According to various harvest, storage, preprocessing, and harvest equipment options, analysis and comparisons were made among different systems.  The capital budgeting model developed in this study generated the optimal feedstock supply chain configurations to determine the largest net present value of cash flow from investment. Results of this study shown that with the Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) incentives, a round bale system using feedstock stored without tarp on pallets using custom hired equipment had the largest positive net present value. By comparison, if all the harvest equipment is purchased rather than custom hired, the stretch wrap baler preprocessing systems, using switchgrass harvested by a chopper with rotary cutter-header, was found to have a cost advantage over conventional hay harvest logistic systems (large round bale and large square bale systems) and pellet preprocessing systems. Assuming most likely values for switchgrass price and production costs, none of the feed stock supply chain configurations evaluated in this study produced a positive net present value when BCAP subsidies were assumed to not be available. However, without the BCAP incentives and based on combination of optimistic assumption, the round bale system using feedstock stored without tarp on pallets using custom hired equipment still has the largest positive net present value. Without the BCAP incentives, no feedstock supply chain configuration using purchased rather than custom hired equipment generated a positive net present value.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Behavior of Precast Bridge Deck Joints with Small Bend Diameter U-Bars</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Chapman, Cheryl Elizabeth</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The Interstate Highway System plays a vital role in our economic development by providing a continuous corridor for transporting goods and services.  Currently, there is a need for repair and expansion of the existing highways, which include all bridges along its path.  Because of the high demand for the highway system, repair and expansion must occur rapidly and efficiently.  In recent years, precast bridge deck systems have become an efficient way to reduce construction time during repair.
This thesis presents the experimental research of the behavior of the U-Bar joint detail used in precast bridge deck systems.  This detail consists of staggered reinforcement extending beyond the precast deck portion into the joint.  Six specimens utilizing the U-Bar detail were constructed and tested.  Three specimens were tested in flexure to simulate the forces applied in a longitudinal deck joint, while three specimens were tested in pure tension to simulate the forces experienced in a transverse deck joint located over an interior pier.  A tight 180° bend at 3db was desired in order to minimize the thickness of the deck.  To achieve this tight bend, deformed wire reinforcement was chosen for the U-Bar detail due to the favorable material properties of deformed wire reinforcement.  The purpose of the testing was to determine if the joint details could generate a precast deck system that could emulate the monolithic cast-in-place deck systems already in use.  For monolithic behavior in a precast deck system, the joints must be able transfer shear, tension and moments.
In this research, the joint overlap length was the most dominant variable, and should not be less than 152.4 mm (6”).  The precast bridge deck joint should consist of high strength concrete with f’c of at least 68.9 MPa (10 ksi).  The longitudinal reinforcement spacing should be no greater than 152.4 mm (6”).</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A descriptive study of sustainability strategies among local parks and recreation departments in Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Yowell, Jennifer</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis represents the first study ever performed in the state of Tennessee on the usage of ecological sustainability strategies in the local parks and an analysis of the existing barriers preventing their implementation. A survey was e-mailed to all of the 105 Tennessee Recreation Park Association park directors requesting this data. As a result of this analysis, a list of 34 environmentally friendly sustainability strategies has been identified that should be considered for implementation in the local parks by their directors. The most common perceptions the directors listed as barriers to their implementation of sustainability strategies included staff knowledge, budget constraints and the number of staff.
This thesis should serve as a catalysis for further study and should the basis for a concerted effort to develop comprehensive sustainability action plans with measurable objectives for the local parks throughout the entire state of Tennessee. Oregon is the only state that has such an operational action plan for its parks in existence. The Oregon state legislature through state law has required the state and local parks to achieve their sustainability goals by 2014.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Inventory, Characterization, and Classification of Minesoils in the Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Jones, Cassi Savage</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The aim of Part One was to discover and investigate the physical and chemical properties of coal minesoils occurring within the Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area (BSF) in order to better understand the nature of these anthropogenic soils. In particular, this information was to identify which, if any, un-reclaimed or recently reclaimed minesoils were actively producing acid mine drainage (AMD) and what properties were inhibiting revegetation.  Historical knowledge and maps were used to locate more than 30 un-reclaimed and reclaimed minesoil sites, which were mapped with GPS. Soil profiles were exposed on 18 sites and grab samples taken on another 12. The morphological properties of each full profile were described according to the National Soil Survey Handbook and samples were taken from each horizon. Chemical properties analyzed for include: particle size, acid-base account, pH, exchangeable aluminum, manganese oxides, soil organic carbon, cation-exchange capacity, exchangeable bases, Mehlich I-extractable elements, and total elemental concentrations.
Significant differences in the following properties (averaged) were discovered between the un-reclaimed and reclaimed minesoils: slope, percent rock fragments, dominant lithology, net neutralization potential, pH, extractable aluminum, base saturation, several Mehlich I-extractable nutrients and total elemental concentrations. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed similar findings and also highlighted instances where reclaimed minesoils were statistically more similar to un-reclaimed minesoils than to other reclaimed minesoils. This indicated that reclamation efforts may not have been completely successful on  these sites.
In Part Two, minesoil profiles were classified according to Soil Taxonomy and according to proposed amendments by the International Committee for Anthropogenic Soils (ICOMANTH). The ICOMANTH amendments provided more informative classifications for coal minesoils in the BSF however, shortcomings were noted. Additional recommendations were made and the minesoils were again classified according to these recommendations. Compared to both the Soil Taxonomy and the ICOMANTH classifications, those according to the proposed additional amendments revealed more of the unique properties of the minesoils studied in this project. The results of this study can aid the National Park Service with future land management of the minesoils located within the BSF boundaries and other users of drastically disturbed minesoils.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Four Aspects of Dogwood Pollination: Insect Visitation, a Novel approach to Identify Pollen, Floral Volatile Emission, and Tracking Parentage</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Rhoades, Paul Raymond</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Part 1: Visitation of potential pollinators to Cornus florida and C. kousa flowers was assessed in East Tennessee in 2008 and 2009.  Data regarding insect visitation rates to multiple trees per location were gathered throughout the flowering period.  Diurnal and seasonal variations in visitation were recorded.  Pollen coverage was assessed on portions of captured insect exoskeletons that were most likely to contact the stigma. Eleven families in four insect orders were collected from C. florida and 26 families in five orders from C. kousa.  The most important pollinators in eastern Tennessee were bees in the Andrenidae and Halictidae.  The most common visitors to C. kousa flowers were scarab, cerambycid and cantharid beetles. Halictid bees were also frequent visitors to C. kousa.
Part 2: Dispersion of flowering dogwood pollen in an orchard was evaluated by performing parentage analysis on open pollinated seedlings collected from a single maternal tree.  Pollen source for 45 seedling trees were established using three polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci.  The expected leptokurtic distribution was not seen.   Although the majority of paternal trees were within the 12 m radius of the study area, the trees most likely to donate pollen were some of the furthest away.   Unusual pollen movement may be a product of lack of synchronization of flowering times between the mother tree and potential pollen donors in the area.  Additionally relative proportions of certain pollinating insects (andrenid and halictid bees) may have moved pollen further than expected.
Appendix 1: Pollen from 6 species in the genus Cornus was analyzed with Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy to determine the utility of this tool to identify pollen grains to species.  Although there were differences visible in the spectra, principal components analysis coupled with cluster analysis could not consistently identify pollen grains.
Appendix 2:  Floral volatile emissions from 6 species of Cornus were collected in a headspace chamber and analyzed with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine if differences between emitted volatiles of C. florida and C. kousa explain differences in floral insect visitation.  The relationship between floral volatile emission and the phylogeny of Cornus was also examined.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Geographic and Temporal Diversification Patterns in the Barcheek Darter Species Group</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hollingsworth Jr., Phillip Ray</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to investigate geographic and temporal diversification patterns in the barcheek darter species group. Specifically, my two questions were “Is there geographical structure of alleles or haplotypes within currently recognized species that is suggestive of unrecognized, or cryptic, species diversity within the clade?” (geographic diversification pattern) and “How old are inter- and intraspecific divergence events in the evolutionary history of the clade?” (temporal diversification pattern). A three gene dataset from 159 barcheek individuals of two mitochondrial coding regions, cyt b and ND2, along with a nuclear intron, S7, was analyzed using parsimony and Bayesian phylogentic methods to answer the first question. Divergence times were estimated using fossil calibration of this Bayesian phylogeny in order to answer the second question. Three barcheek species were found to have significant population structure suggestive of cryptic species diversity. E. basilare in particular was recovered as being comprised of five reciprocally monophyletic clades endemic to each of the major tributaries to the upper Caney Fork River. Inter- and intraspecific divergence events were found to be relatively old in the clade, nearly all pre-Pleistocene, with a crown node age estimated at 12.68 mya. These results are discussed in light of the present understanding of the tempo of diversification in the darter radiation.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Boiling and Microwaving Effects on Hydrophilic Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity of Frozen Vegetables</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Rogers, Merry Frances</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Decreased risks of chronic illnesses, such as cancer, occur with increased consumption of dietary antioxidants. Vegetables are a particularly rich source of dietary antioxidants but these are primarily water soluble compounds. This research determined effects of microwaving or boiling on the antioxidant capacities of commercially frozen vegetables. Hydrophilic components were extracted by Acetone/Deionized water/Acetic Acid (700:295:50, v/v) from commercially frozen broccoli, carrots, sweet corn, and sweet peas before and after microwaving for 5 min or boiling for 10 min. The Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) assay was employed to determine the antioxidant capacity. Additionally, color and texture analyses were performed.
ORAC values from uncooked, microwaved or boiled broccoli were 11.33, 8.04 and 5.72 μmol TE/g; ORAC values for peas were 10.2, 5.14 and 2.43 μmol TE/g; ORAC values for corn were 6.32, 8.12 and 4.45 μmol TE/g; and ORAC values for carrots were 2.95, 4.00, and 2.39 μmol TE/g.
No significant ORAC and texture correlations were determined. The only significant color and ORAC correlation was for the a* value of peas (p&lt;0.05). A negative moderate correlation existed; therefore, greener peas had greater ORAC values.
These results demonstrate that boiling vegetables for 10 min results in lower ORAC values and boiled broccoli, peas and corn contained significantly lower values (p&lt;0.05) than uncooked broccoli or peas and microwaved corn. Boiled vegetables have been found to contain significantly lower water soluble nutrients due to loss into the cooking water. ORAC analysis of cooking water from each of the four vegetables verified the loss of antioxidant constituents since the water was found to contain increased antioxidant capacity. The greatest ORAC values were found in the water after boiling broccoli and the lowest ORAC values were found in the water after cooking carrots. Addition of antioxidant capacities of cooked vegetables in nutritional databases would be useful to consumers wanting to increase consumption of antioxidants.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF MEMORY AND COMPUTATIONALLY BOUND CHEMISTRY APPLICATIONS ON STREAMING GPGPUS AND MULTI-CORE X86 CPUS</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Weber III, Frederick E</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In recent years, multi-core processors have come to dominate the field in desktop and high performance computing. Graphics processors traditionally used in CAD, video games, and other 3-d applications, have become more programmable and are now suitable for general purpose computing. This thesis explores multi-core processors and GPU performance and limitations in two computational chemistry applications: a memory bound component of ab-initio modeling and a computationally bound Monte Carlo simulation. For the applications presented in this thesis, exploiting multiple processors is done using a variety of tools and languages including OpenMP and MKL. Brook+ and the Compute Abstraction Layer streaming environments are used to accelerate applications on AMD GPUs. This thesis gives qualitative assertions about these languages and tools regarding ease of use and optimization in addition to quantitative analyses of performance. GPUs can yield modest performance improvements with little effort in some applications and even larger speedups with simple optimizations.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Improved Methodologies for Biomass Wet Chemical Analysis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kline, Lindsey McCulloch</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this thesis study was to further the development of lignocellulosic biomass as a potential renewable energy source by investigating new wet chemical compositional analysis techniques to be used to monitor changes in biomass composition resulting from size reduction and separation processes such grinding and sieving. Numerous disadvantages to the standard wet chemical analysis procedure as developed by US Dept of Energy and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) were identified as targets for possible improvements. The overall objective was utilization of ionic liquids as a “green” alternative to the use of aqueous acidic solvents employed in the NREL protocol. These experiments included direct spectral analyses to quantify the lignin constituent, and successive enzymatic hydrolysis for quantification of the cellulose constituent.
Results contained herein revealed that solubilization of biomass occurred in ionic liquids, which allowed for rapid spectroscopic determination of its lignin composition. The enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose occurred in an ionic liquid-rich solvent system, and quantification of the cellulolytic monosaccharide products was achieved using high performance liquid chromatography.
Motivated by the disadvantages associated with the NREL biomass compositional analysis procedure, a new analysis procedure utilizing ionic liquids was proposed and developed as an approach aimed towards improving laboratory safety and analysis time. The study was approached by first quantifying the solubility of biomass in ionic liquids. Direct quantification of the lignin content was conducted by two methods, UV-visible spectrophotometric analyses after the addition of a dilution agent, acetonitrile, and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The cellulose component of yellow poplar was then completely hydrolyzed using a cellulolytic enzyme in the ionic liquid-rich reaction media, and the hydrolysate was then analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography for the quantification of glucose monomeric units.
Success was achieved in the design of the analysis procedure, and it was employed for the quantification of lignin and cellulose in yellow poplar. There was also a highly predictable conversion of cellulose to glucose and cellobiose by the cellulase in the ionic liquid-rich reaction media. A biomass compositional analysis procedure for the quantification of lignin and cellulose was created and was observed to be consistent in comparison with the results from the NREL protocol. The total lignin content as a percent of dry mass in yellow poplar was found to be 25.1% ± 0.8 using the NREL protocol, and 21.5% ± 0.4 and 25.6% ± 0.1 by the UV-visible and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy approaches, respectively, in the methods described herein. The glucan component was quantified as 43.5% ± 0.5 utilizing the NREL protocol and 43.6% ± 0.3 through analysis of the enzymatic hydrolysate as part of these methodologies.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Commercial Household Disinfectant Inactivation of Bacillus cereus Spores on Fruit and Vegetable Surfaces</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kerr, Helen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Studies were conducted to test the efficacy of several common household products containing antimicrobial compounds for inactivating spores of Bacillus cereus, as a surrogate for B. anthracis, on fresh fruit or vegetables. Additionally, the effect of storage time on hypochlorite activity of household products was determined. Bacillus cereus ATCC 33018 and ATCC 49064 were used in a cocktail for all tests. Household disinfectant and/or cleaning products with potential for sanitization were purchased in a retail market and were selected based upon efficacy against B. cereus in previous tests in milk. The active components were NaOCl, HCl or H2O2. For produce, cantaloupe melons and spinach were obtained from a local retail market and rinsed with sterile deionized (DI) water. Cantaloupe rinds were removed, trimmed to remove the mesocarp, cut into 25 cm2 sections and placed in sterile Petri dishes. Sections of melon and spinach leaves were spot inoculated with 0.1 ml of B. cereus and allowed to dry for 30 min at 25oC. Sanitizing products were sprayed onto the surface of the produce and the produce was allowed to stand for various times. Produce was then placed in neutralizer buffer to arrest the activity of sanitizing compounds and survivors were enumerated on non-selective media. To determine the effect of product age on activity, three commercial NaOCl-containing products that were past, at and 6 mo from the expiration dates were evaluated. Spinach and cantaloupe were tested as described previously. For the cantaloupe melon rind the control population mean was 7.15 + 0.07 log CFU/cm2. The log reduction was &gt; 5.15 for undiluted NaOCl (Clorox®, 6.00% NaOCl) and inactivation took 120 min though the greatest reduction was observed in the first 10 min. For products containing 1.84%-2.40% NaOCl, log reductions were 2.75 to 3.40 over 180 min. For spinach, the control population mean was 7.37 + 0.01 log CFU/leaf. A &gt; 5.84 log reduction in B. cereus spores was found for both undiluted NaOCl (Clorox®) and HCl (The Works Drain Opener, 20.00% HCl). However, the former reduced the viable spore population to the lowest detection level in 10 to 60 min while the latter took approximately 3 h. A 4.23-4.60 log reduction occurred with the 1.84%-2.40% NaOCl-containing products after 180 min. Hydrogen peroxide had the least effective sporicidal capabilities of the solutions tested reducing the population by less than 1 log. With respect to effect of storage on sporicidal activity of HOCl-containing products, samples stored up to 1 year past expiration were compared with those stored for 6 months prior to expiration and purchased fresh. There was no significant difference in the in vitro inactivation of B. cereus spores among the products. B. cereus spores were inactivated to below detectable levels after 1 min in 50% and 25% commercial strength solutions (&gt;4.0 log CFU/ml). These findings were confirmed utilizing cantaloupe rind and spinach leaves treated with HOCl-containing products of the same storage times. B. cereus spores were inactivated to below the level of detection (&gt;5.84 log CFU/cm2, &gt;5.15 log CFU/cm2) in 10 min and 60 min for spinach and cantaloupe respectively, regardless of compound age.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Freedom to Work, Nothing More nor Less: The Freedmen’s Bureau, White Planters, and Black Contract Laborers in Postwar Tennessee, 1865-1868</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Leventhal, David Stanley</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis explores the black labor situation in postwar Tennessee from 1865 to 1868. Using a wide array of primary sources from Tennessee, the research unveils an inherent bias in the Freedmen’s Bureau’s forced contract system of labor. My conclusions highlight the collusion and complacency of bureau officials and planters who confined freedpeople to agricultural labor during the initial years of African-American freedom. Whites—Northern and Southern—worked cohesively toward common goals of agricultural prosperity, law and order, and white supremacy.
The bureau’s contract system was devised as an emergency measure to put idle blacks back in their “appropriate” positions as agricultural laborers, but bureau officials failed to recognize that freedpeople refusing to work on farms were not lazy and irresponsible; rather, they were discontented with former slaveholders and desperate for non-plantation work. Contracts served the needs of the planter class and the free-labor proponents of the North. The bureau restored order and productivity to Tennessee by providing ex-slaveowners with the legal means to acquire cheap and exploitable labor. Formal stipulations codified the old system of enslavement through a new medium, and bureau-approved contracts became the new figurative overseers of African-American agricultural laborers in the post-emancipation South.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An Experimental Analysis of the Laminar Separation Bubble At Low Reynolds Numbers</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Swift, Karla Marie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper is an investigation into the laminar separation bubble that frequently plagues airborne vehicles operating in the low Reynolds number regime – experimentally found to be typically present in flows with Reynolds numbers below 106 (Lissaman 1983). The specific application driving the present investigation is the fixed wing performance of unmanned micro air vehicles (MAVs), defined by their maximum chord length of 6 inches and current cruising speeds of 10-20 meters per second (Mueller 2001). A basic generic model was chosen for this investigation: a circular arc (section of 16 inch diameter PVC pipe) with sharp leading and trailing edges having a chord length of 9.3 inches and height of 1.5 inches. This airfoil model was tested in the UTSI water tunnel at Reynolds numbers of 27,000 and 45,000. The goal of this study was to gain some insight into the boundary layer behaviour through the use of dye injection for flow visualization and hot film anemometry for quantitative velocity measurements. Small diameter cylinders were then statically placed upstream of the model to determine their interaction with the laminar separation bubble and its effects on the boundary layer downstream over the airfoil model. The length and height of the laminar separation bubble was found to be impacted with a small cylindrical wire placed upstream at all Reynolds numbers and angles of attack with the exception of an 18 degree angle of attack at the higher Reynolds number. However, these changes did not result in a substantial or distinguishable improvement in the downstream separation point. The laminar separation bubble was found to be nearly or completely eliminated when a thermocouple wire was placed upstream of the leading edge. Although the elimination of the bubble would result in only a minor decrease in drag and increase in lift, there would be a possible improvement in the stability of the leading edge stall and possible reduction or elimination in the hysteresis associated with stall.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Analysis and Comparison of Effects of an Airfoil or a Rod on Supersonic Cavity Flow.</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Fowler, William Leland</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The effects of an airfoil at different angles of attack and a circular cylindrical rod within the edge of the boundary layer flow at the leading edge of a cavity as a device for controlling the large pressure fluctuations (resonance tones) in the cavity were investigated. The airfoil results were compared with the rod in crossflow method positioned at the same leading edge location. The cavity used for testing corresponded to a length to depth ratio, L/D of 11.0/2.25 with a length to width ratio, L/W of 11.0/3.00 at a freestream Mach 1.84 flow. The study included measurements of dynamic pressure transducer output at 40 kHz and Frequency Spectra calculations, using Schlieren techniques for shock wave structures with velocity and vorticity fields obtained from PIV measurements. All airfoil configurations experienced flow separation to varying degrees.  The negative 10 degree angle of attack configuration experienced the greatest amount of flow separation. All airfoil configurations provided varying degrees of cavity (resonant) tone suppression. Of the airfoil configurations, the negative 10 degree airfoil provided the best noise suppression with a 5 dB SPL reduction in broadband noise and a 9 dB reduction in peak amplitude for the 3rd resonant mode. Although all the airfoil configurations provided various levels of noise suppression, none of the configurations performed to the level of the rod in crossflow technique which provided an 8 dB SPL reduction in broadband noise and a 22 dB reduction in peak amplitude for the 2nd resonant mode. Indications of shear flow lofting effects could not be studied within any of the configurations tested. Lofting effect testing would have required flow field visualization of the cavity trailing edge region. Dynamic pressure measurements at a location near the cavity trailing edge did not detect the rod vortex shedding frequency, clearly. Because PIV results showed strong indication of vortex shedding, the lack of vortex shedding frequency data was attributed to the dynamic pressure transducer being located a far distance of 44 rod diameters downstream of the rod location. All airfoil test configurations showed evidence of deflections to the cavity leading edge oblique shock wave. The mechanisms of the deflection were the airfoil trailing edge shocks interacting with the cavity leading edge shock.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Methods for characterizing mechanical properties of wood cell walls via nanoindentation</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Meng, Yujie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Nanoindentation is a method of contacting a material whose mechanical properties are unknown with another material whose properties are known.  Nanoindentation has the advantage of being able to probe a material’s microstructure while being sensitive enough to detect variations in mechanical properties. However, nanoindentation has some limitations as a testing technique due to the specific formation and structure of some biomaterials. The main objective of this research is to identify any factors that influence the nanoindentation measurement of wood cell walls (a typical biomaterial).
The function of the embedding media in describing the properties of wood cells is poorly understood. This research demonstrated that Spurr’s resin, when diffused into wood cell wall during the embedding process, enhanced both the Young’s modulus and hardness of the cell walls. A substitute sample preparation method was developed to avoid this resin penetration into cell wall and was determined to be both effective and easy to perform.
The nanoindentation procedure involves the application of a monitor and an analysis of the load-displacement behavior and the response in the material. It can be anticipated that various ways of loading, including the maximum force, the loading time, and others, will cause a variety of mechanical properties. Thus, our second aim was to study the effect of load function on nanoindentation measurement in wood. It was discovered that a fast loading rate contributed to greater contact depth and lower hardness. Increasing the holding time decreased measured values for both Young’s modulus and hardness. However, no significant difference of Young’s modulus and hardness among three loading functions with different unloading rates.
The final part of the research was to study the effect of moisture content on the micromechanical properties of wood material. Several nanoindentations were performed on the wood cell wall while varying the moisture content of wood. Results indicated that both the Young’s modulus and hardness decreased significantly with an increase of moisture content. A rheology model was developed to describe the nanoindentation behaviors of wood cell walls at different moisture contents. Five parameters were extracted from Burger’s model, and the relationships among those five parameters were quantified.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Mesophase Pitch-based Carbon Fiber and Its Composites:  Preparation and Characterization</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Liu, Chang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship among process, structure, and property of the UTSI pitch-based carbon fibers and optimize carbon fiber’s mechanical properties through the stabilization process. Various analysis techniques were employed throughout these investigations which include the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), optical microscope, Dia-stron system, MTS, and ImageJ.
Several fiber process techniques including fiber spinning, stabilization, and carbonization were explored to determine the effect of the thermal process on the fiber yield, fiber diameter, the sheath-core structure of stabilized fibers, the pac-man and hollow core structures of carbonized fibers, and the resulting mechanical properties of the carbon fibers.  It was found that stabilization time and the temperature stepping had a great deal on influence on the resulting carbon fibers. Larger diameter fiber is easy to form sheath-core structure in the stabilization process. Pac-man structure was developed at 600°C during the carbonization. Both stabilization duration and the carbonization temperature control the resulting carbon fiber diameter and fiber structure defects such as the pac-man and hollow core defects. Multi-step stabilization can reduce the total stabilization duration and improve the mechanical properties of the resulting carbon fibers.
Fiber structure non-uniformities including fiber diameter distributions for a bundle fiber or along a single fiber, and pac-man angles were determined. Statistical analysis revealed the distribution of the carbon fiber cross-sectional areas and the result is compared against commercial available carbon fibers.
Carbon fiber sandwiched composites (CFSCs) were fabricated with UTSI carbon fiber and commercial PAN-based carbon fibers.  Several configurations of sandwich structured composites were explored to test the flexural properties with varying sandwich thickness.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Beyond the Walls: The Architecture of Imprisonment and Community</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Parrish, Neil Lawrence</dc:creator>
<dc:description>ABSTRACTThe purpose of this thesis is to investigate the role architecture plays in both causing and ameliorating cycles of crime and punishment. To accomplish this task, the study combines an investigation of historical prison typologies, with an investigation into the philosophical and ethical questions surrounding the practice of imprisonment itself, as well as in depth sociological and criminological studies of the ways in which crime and incarceration affect the health of communities over time.  It then employs the tools and conclusions of these studies to investigate the change over time in a singe community in North Memphis, Tennessee from its roots as a thriving, multi-racial industrial hub to a community defined by endemic crime, poverty, and violence and, finally, to suggest a way to improve the health of the community through the prison system itself. The study concludes that the prison system as it currently exists must undergo a fundamental philosophical and physical change in order to actually meet the goals of reducing crime and improving community health for which it was intended. To that end, the thesis suggests a vision of an incarceration facility for a single community in North Memphis that uses architecture as a vehicle to instrumentalize the key emotion that defines imprisonment -- how to escape from it -- in order to reconcile prisoners back to the communities they have offended.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Development and Use of a Computer Program “Hyper-N” to Predict the Performance of Air Vehicles Traveling at Hypersonic Speeds</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Baalla, Younes</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Abstract The main objective of this thesis was to develop a method than can be used to approximate the pressure forces on air vehicles traveling at hypersonic speed (Mach number &gt; 5). The aerodynamic forces such as lift and drag were calculated from the pressure values on the surface of the airplane. Pitching moment was also tabulated.  This work was initiated based on the idea of developing a flow solver proficient and capable of providing aerodynamic data (lift and drag look-up tables) for hypersonic air vehicles that can be fed to a flight simulator (used by the Aviation Systems Department) at the University of Tennessee Space Institute. Several approximation methods are used to solve hypersonic such as shock expansion method. Based on different studies, Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) proved to produce very accurate results; however, it is a difficult technique to use.  In this thesis work Newtonian Method was adopted as a technique to approximate the aerodynamic forces and hence the performance of hypersonic airplanes, therefore, a computer program (Hyper-N) has been developed for aerodynamic analysis of three dimensional geometries airplane.  The program is designed to read in a previously configured list of plates and compute the aerodynamic forces and moments for hypersonic free stream conditions. Programming was completed using MatLab language. The results obtained from the Hyper-N program were for the experimental airplane X-43A which were found to match the results when the shock expansion method is used for the same airplane, [1].  Because of the difficulties involve in using CFD or the complete Navier Stocks equation to obtain the aerodynamic forces on bodies traveling at hypersonic speeds, the Newtonian method is considered to be the most efficient technique to use for preliminary evaluation of the performance of hypersonic airplanes. Modified Newtonian theory and the computational requirement of the code are described. A number of geometric configurations, including the X-43A (experimental hypersonic) airplane, are provided as examples of applications of the Hyper-N program.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An Examination of the Deliberate Practice Framework in Quad Rugby</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Boxell, Rachel Lynn</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Ericsson, Krampe, and Tesch-Römer (1993) forwarded a general framework to account for the characteristics and developmental experiences of individuals who have acquired exceptional performance in any domain. This framework proposed that experts undergo an extensive acquisition period involving the accumulation of thousands of hours of deliberate practice while overcoming various constraints that serve as functional barriers to the achievement of expertise. The purpose of this study was to examine expert disability-sport athletes to determine how well their experiences and characteristics were captured by Ericsson et al.’s (1993) framework. In Part I, quad rugby players recalled the amount of time spent in individual and team practice activities, quad rugby related activities, and daily life activities at the start of their career and every two years since. In Part II, these activities were rated with respect to relevance to improving performance, effort and concentration required, and enjoyment of participation. Findings revealed that quad rugby athletes engaged in similar amounts of practice throughout their career to those observed in superior performers across domains, including Ericsson et al.’s musicians and expert performers in the able-bodied sport domain (e.g., Helsen, Starkes, &amp; Hodges, 1998). Contrary to the original deliberate practice framework as described by Ericsson et al. (1993), results indicated that disability-sport athletes did not rate the most relevant and effortful activities as low on enjoyment..</dc:description>

			<dc:title>PVT Compensation for Single-Slope Measurement Systems</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Tham, Kevin Vun Kiat</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A pulse-width locked loop (PWLL) circuit is reported that compensates for process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations of a linear ramp generator within a 12-bit multi-channel Wilkinson (single-slope integrating) Analog-to-Digital (ADC). This PWLL was designed and fabricated in a 0.5-um Silicon Germanium (SiGe) BiCMOS process.  The PWLL architecture that is comprised of a phase detector, a charge-pump, and a pulse width modulator (PWM), is discussed along with the design details of the primary blocks. Simulation and silicon measurement data are shown that demonstrate a large improvement in the accuracy of the PVT-compensated ADC over the uncompensated ADC.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Call Center Simulation Study: Comparing the Reliability of Cross-Trained Agents to Specialized Agents</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ali III, Louis Franklin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Call centers are an important function of most companies’ day to day business activities. They are often the link between a company and its customers and hugely impact the customer’s perspective or point of view (POV) of a company. A call center in the most general sense is a place, representing a business, which receives inbound calls from customers and/or makes outbound calls to customers, the latter being most commonly referred to as telemarketing. There was a time when a typical call center strictly consisted of agents who handled inbound/outbound calls; these agents are considered specialized agents. Generally speaking, a specialized agent is one trained, in-depth, in a particular area of knowledge.
Most businesses have transgressed from your typical call center into contact centers. Contact centers operate essentially the same as a call center but interact with the customer in a variety of ways including, but not limited to: Phone, Mail, Fax, Email, and Internet (via online chat and instant messaging applications). The dynamics of these kinds of call centers has caused an increase in the need for agents to become more diverse in their talents and abilities to handle different types of calls. This has lead to specialized agents becoming general or “cross-trained” agents in which they are trained, broadly, over several areas of knowledge.
The purpose of this thesis is to compare specialized agents to cross-trained agents and through the use of simulation, determine which of the two are more efficient and reliable in their ability to service the customer. This thesis has three major components: Simulation, Reliability Analysis, and Comparison.  The results indicate that a cross-trained model is more reliable and efficient than a specialized model.  Performance metrics common to call center literature, simulation, and Lean reliability systems were used to determine the effectiveness and reliability of the two models.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Sex and Neuroticism: Frequent Sex Protects Intimates from the Negative Implications of Their Neuroticism</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Russell, Virginia Michelle</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A robust literature documents numerous negative implications of neuroticism for romantic relationships. The current study was the first to demonstrate necessary information regarding how couples can protect against these implications.  Given the role of negative affect in the association between neuroticism and relationship difficulties, and given the role of sex in reducing negative affect, the current 8-wave longitudinal study of 72 newlywed couples tested the prediction that sexual frequency would moderate the association between neuroticism and marital satisfaction. Lagged multilevel modeling analyses supported this prediction. Specifically, although neuroticism was negatively associated with changes in marital satisfaction among spouses engaging in less frequent sex over the prior 6 months, neuroticism was unrelated to changes in satisfaction among spouses reporting more frequent sex over the prior 6 months. These findings join others in highlighting the importance of considering the broader context of the relationship to developing a complete understanding of relationship development.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Haptic Tele-operation of Wheeled Mobile Robot and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle over the Internet</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Zuo, Zhiyuan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Teleoperation of ground/aerial vehicle extends operator's ability (e.g. expertise, strength, mobility) into the remote environment, and haptic feedback enhances the human operator's perception of the slave environment. In my thesis, two cases are studied: wheeled mobile robot (MWR) haptic tele-driving over the Internet and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) haptic teleoperation over the Internet. We propose novel control frameworks for both dynamic WMR and kinematic WMR in various tele-driving modes, and for a &quot;mixed&quot; UAV with translational dynamics and attitude kinematics. The recently proposed passive set-position modulation (PSPM) framework is extended to guarantee the passivity and/or stability of the closed-loop system with time-varying/packet-loss in the communication; and proved performance in steady state is shown by theoretical measurements.For UAV teleoperation, we also derive a backstepping trajectory tracking control with robustness analysis. Experimental results for dynamic/kinematic WMR and an indoor quadrotor-type UAV are presented to show the efficacy of the proposed control framework.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Using Volunteer Tracking Information for Activity-Based Travel Demand Modeling and Finding Dynamic Interaction-Based Joint-Activity Opportunities</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Xu, Yitu</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Technology used for real-time locating is being used to identify and track the movements of individuals in real time.  With the increased use of mobile technology by individuals, we are now able to explore more potential interactions between people and their living environment using real-time tracking and communication technologies.
One of the potentials that has hardly been taken advantage of is to use cell phone tracking information for activity-based transportation study.  Using GPS-embedded smart phones, it is convenient to continuously record our trajectories in a day with little information loss.  As smart phones get cheaper and hence attract more users, the potential information source for self-tracking data is pervasive.  This study provides a cell phone plus web method that collects volunteer cell phone tracking data and uses an algorithm to identify the allocation of activities and traveling in space and time.  It also provides a step that incorporates user-participated prompted recall attribute identification (travel modes and activity types) which supplements the data preparation for activity-based travel demand modeling.
Besides volunteered geospatial information collection, cell phone users’ real-time locations are often collected by service providers such as Apple, AT&amp;T and many other third-party companies.  This location data has been used in turn to boost new location-based services.  However, few applications have been seen to address dynamic human interactions and spatio-temporal constraints of activities.  This study sets up a framework for a new kind of location-based service that finds joint-activity opportunities for multiple individuals, and demonstrates its feasibility using a spatio-temporal GIS approach.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Tissue culture and recombinant DNA technology: Developing protocols for potentially higher yielding switchgrass cultivars</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Foulk, Stephen Michael</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this thesis project was to, firstly, establish and optimize protocols for high-throughput callus induction and plant regeneration for the new, higher yielding switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) cultivars NSL and SL93. Secondly, to subclone the complementary DNA (cDNA) of the anthocyanin transcription factor, C1, from pBECKS.red into pUC18 and pBSL15 for downstream use.
For the first part of this project the cultivars, NF/GA992, NF/GA993, NSL, and SL93, were tested for callus induction by plating whole dehusked caryopses on callus induction media (CIM) containing 8.5uM of the auxin dicamba. NF/GA992 responded best to the treatment with 44% of plated seeds producing callus.
For the second experiment seeds of the cultivars NSL, SL93, and Alamo were plated on CIM containing various molar concentrations of dicamba (0uM, 8.5uM, 17uM, and 34uM) and 6-benzylamino purine (BAP) (0uM, 5uM, 15uM, and 45uM). This research revealed that the presence of BAP in CIM plates did not promote callus induction in Alamo, SL93, and NSL, but elevated concentrations (34uM) of dicamba significantly increased callus formation in all three cultivars. It was also found that the SL93 callus derived from CIM plates containing 34uM dicamba and 15uM BAP regenerated the most shoots, 27 shoots were regenerated from 3 calluses.
Seed pretreatments were evaluated to determine their impact on callus induction and subsequent plant regeneration. For this experiment, seeds of NSL, SL93, and Alamo were plated on CIM containing 34uM of dicamba. Seeds were subjected to one of three treatments before plating: a) dehusked with H2SO4 , b) chilled for two weeks at 4°C then plated, and c) sterilized with sodium hypochlorite and ethanol. This research revealed that seed pretreatment significantly increased callus induction amongst the three tested cultivars. The second part of this experiment compared the shoot regeneration efficiencies of seed-derived calluses to inflorescence-derived calluses. Analysis showed that SL93 calluses induced from inflorescences produced significantly more shoots than any of the other explants.
The final arm of this thesis  project focused on sub-cloning the C1 anthocyanin regulatory cDNA. The C1 cDNA isolated from pBECKS.red was sub-cloned into pUC18 and pBSL15 using a sticky-end ligation.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Effect of Tailboom Strakes and Vertical Fin Modifications on the Performance and Handling Qualities of OH-58 Helicopters</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wade, John A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The Bell OH-58D helicopter is used in the armed reconnaissance role by the U.S. Army worldwide. Operations in support of this mission require the aircraft to be operated at a hover for extended periods of time at high altitude and in hot conditions. This places large demands on a power limited aircraft and increases pilot workload, especially in the pointing task so important to weapons delivery. The addition of aerodynamic modifications provides an inexpensive and effective method of reducing power required and pilot workload.
An investigation was conducted to determine the effects of adding tailboom strakes and a vertical fin modification (FastFin®) to a Bell OH-58D. The effect of the combined devices on helicopter performance, vibration and handling qualities was evaluated to determine any decrease in power required vs. power available (increased power margin). The strakes and modified fin were attached to the tailboom in such a manner as to alter the flow pattern of air passing over the tailboom. This change in flow pattern reduced the anti-torque requirements of the tail rotor. This in turn reduced the overall power requirement. The modified fin and strake combination reduced the vortices and turbulence at the tailboom and resulted in lower pilot workload and vibration in an out-of-ground-effect hover. This study also evaluated the effects on performance and handling characteristics of the helicopter. Testing included hover, low airspeed forward, rearward, sideward flight and level forward flight power measurements and handling qualities using modified Cooper-Harper and Vibration Assessment Rating (VAR) scales. Results showed an overall improvement in handling qualities and vibration levels at critical wind azimuth angles in low airspeed flight. For out-of-ground effect (OGE) hover, there was also a 2-3% reduction in power required due to the improved aerodynamic efficiency of the modified fin and strake combination.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Theoretical Techniques for Determining Precise Thermophysical Properties</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kassaee, Mohamad Hadi</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Quantum mechanics (QM) calculations, coupled with statistical mechanics (SM), provide a means to obtain thermophysical properties from first principles. Because of the limitations in modern computational resources, many of these properties are obtained for isolated molecules. Despite this limitation, QM is still very useful for thermophysical property generation in an ideal gas reference state where the molecules are isolated.
In this thesis, a combination of quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics calculations is used to generate entropies of aromatic compounds in the ideal gas reference state. This information is necessary for practical calculations such as the determination of the free energy of a reaction involving these compounds and the equilibrium distribution between isomers.
The QM and SM calculation procedure is used to generate entropies of simple aromatic compounds—benzene, toluene, p-xylene, m-xylene and o-xylene— in the ideal gas state from 250 K to 540 K. Having accurate experimental frequencies and entropies for these compounds from literature, we systematically examine how the choice of the QM level of theory impacts the agreement between theory and experiment. The calculated entropies fall within 0.5% of experimentally determined values for these compounds. We acknowledge that given the state of the art of computational quantum mechanics today, all levels of theory require an empirical scaling factor for vibrational frequencies. This empirical scaling factor largely eliminates the advantage in accuracy of more sophisticated levels of theory. Thus we see that our “purely computational” estimates of the entropy still have a fundamental connection to experiment through this single empirical scaling factor.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Adsorption of 2-Ketogluconate by Goethite</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Journey, Jessica Suzanne</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The low-molecular-mass-organic acid, 2-ketogluconate (kG), has been found to exist in significant concentrations in the rhizosphere of agricultural soils. Adsorption of kG by constant potential mineral surfaces may influence soil chemical processes. This study examines influence of temperature, pH, and ionic environment on the adsorption of kG by goethite. When kG was present on the surface of goethite, the pHpzc decreased by approximately 0.4 pH units, from pH 7.6 to pH 7.2, suggesting that kG is chemisorbed to the goethite surface via ligand exchange mechanisms. The adsorption of kG by goethite is a function of pH and ionic strength. In pH 5 systems, the adsorption of kG increased with decreasing ionic strength at 25°C and 45°C, while at 7°C adsorption was noted to decrease slightly with decreasing ionic strength. The shape of the kG adsorption isotherms indicates high-intensity retention, suggesting inner-sphere surface complexation. In pH 9 systems, the adsorption of kG increased with increasing ionic strength at all temperatures, also suggesting inner-sphere complexation. The adsorption of kG was also a function of temperature. Adsorption increased with increasing temperature, indicating that the adsorption process was endothermic. Thermodynamic evaluations also showed that the heat of adsorption was consistent with a chemisorption process and that kG adsorption was entropically driven, which is characteristic of ligand exchange processes. Results from this study are consistent with those of previous research and suggest that kG is retained by the goethite surface via ligand exchange mechanisms.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Sedimentologic and Stratigraphic Analysis of Units Defining the Basal Sauk Supersequence Across the Craton Margin Hinge Zone, Southeastern California</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hogan, Eric Gordon</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In the Death Valley and Mojave Desert regions of southeastern California, the contact separating the lower and middle members of the Wood Canyon Formation (WCF) is currently interpreted as a regional scale unconformity coincident with the base of the Sauk Sequence.  Regional mapping of this surface, however, reveals a nonconformable contact with underlying crystalline basement in cratonic settings, and a relatively conformable contact atop a northwest thickening wedge of miogeoclinal strata that is capped by the lower member of the WCF.  Consistent with an unconformity, the progressive loss of three carbonate units within the lower member of the WCF has been attributed to incision by the base of the middle member WCF.  However, fossil evidence and correlation based on carbon isotope compositions of each lower member WCF dolostone units rejects top-down erosion to describe their loss and overall cratonward thinning.  Results from multiple detailed, measured, stratigraphic sections of a conglomerate found at the base or low in the middle member WCF also do not support a top-down erosion model because the conglomerate has variable stratigraphic position and absence in some locations.  Middle member WCF conglomerate clasts also reveal variation in composition and grain size across the regions.  Sequence stratigraphic architecture indicates that filling of available accommodation space and short period normal regression, as opposed to a forced regression, are the causal mechanisms for formation of the basal middle member WCF unconformity, and that the base of the Sauk Sequence rests lower in the stratigraphic section.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Oak Savanna Restoration and Management in the Mid-South</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Barrioz, Seth A</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Oak savannas are among the most imperiled ecosystems in the United States as a result of habitat degradation and consequently, associated vegetation and wildlife communities have also declined.  I evaluated savanna restoration strategies on twelve case studies in Tennessee and Kentucky.  These case studies represented a broad range of disturbances and the most advanced savanna restoration sites within the region.  I evaluated vegetation and breeding bird responses to landscape and overstory conditions across sites through a meta-analysis.  Total grass and forb cover were influenced by overstory metrics but not by topography (P &gt;0.05).  Oak regeneration density was influenced by canopy cover, while oak competitor regeneration density was influenced by percent slope and sapling density (P &lt;0.05).  With respect to breeding birds, I found forest species persisted within case studies despite substantial disturbance; shrub/scrub birds were common on disturbed sites.  Only three obligate grassland bird species, Tyrannus tyrannus, Aimophila aestivalis, Spiza americana, were observed on my sites. Relative abundance of Passerina cyanea was positively related to the groundlayer development; whereas that of Melanerpes erythrocephalus was positively related to basal area of dead trees (P &lt;0.05).  Based on my results, canopy reduction and growing-season burns may both be critical for the restoration of savannas within the region.
Drum-chopping is a tool that may expedite oak savanna restoration through improved woody competition control, however, its effectiveness has not been investigated.  Therefore, I evaluated drum-chopping effects on vegetative structure at Catoosa Wildlife Management Area, Tennessee, during 2008 and 2009 using two adjacent sites with similar fire and overstory removal histories.  One site was subjected to drum-chopping in September of 2007, while an adjacent site (control) was not chopped.  Drum-chopping reduced grass and forb cover, and oak seedling density, but increased bare ground and density of vines and shrubs versus the control (P &lt;0.05).  Except for bare ground, differences were no longer apparent in the second year.  Based on my results, drum chopping may reduce midstory vegetation too thick to be effectively controlled by fire, but otherwise has limited utility as a restoration tool.
Although wildlife managers have tried to restore savannas using prescribed fire and overstory canopy removal, use of other tools may be warranted.  One such method is drum-chopping, which has been used elsewhere to reduce woody competition.  However, the effectiveness of this method in restoring oak savannas has not been evaluated.  Therefore, I evaluated drum-chopping effects on plant composition at Catoosa Wildlife Management Area on the Cumberland Plateau in Tennessee.  Two adjacent sites with similar fire and overstory removal histories were selected for this study.  One of these sites was subjected to drum-chopping (CHOP) in September of 2007, the adjacent site was not chopped (NOCHOP).  Grass cover differed by treatment (P &lt;0.01) and year*treatment (P = 0.03).  Forb cover differed by treatment (P &lt;0.01) and legume cover differed by year (P &lt;0.01), treatment (P &lt;0.01), and year*treatment (P = 0.01).  Exposed bare ground differed by year (P &lt;0.01) and treatment (P &lt;0.01). Exposed leaf litter differed by year (P &lt;0.01).  Vines and shrubs (&lt;1.37m tall) differed by treatment (P &lt;0.01).  Oak seedling (0-30.48 cm tall) densities differed by treatment (P = 0.05).  Based on my results, drum chopping may be a valuable tool where woody encroachment has become too thick for fire to be effective or herbicides are not a viable option, but otherwise has limited utility as a tool for oak savanna restoration.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Measuring the Value of Air Quality: Application of the Spatial-Hedonic Model</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kim, Seung Gyu</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The value of air quality improvement following the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments is estimated at the county level in the lower 48 United States. This study applies a hedonic model to assess the economic benefits of air quality improvement using an instrumental variable approach that combines geographically weighted and spatial autoregression methods to account for spatial heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation. Positive amenity values of improved air quality are found in five major clusters of areas across Eastern Kentucky and most of Georgia around Southern Appalachian area, the State of Illinois, on the border of Oklahoma and Kansas, on the border of Kansas and Nebraska, and Eastern Texas. The reason for the clusters of significant positive amenity values may be due to the combination of intense air pollution, consumers’ awareness of diminishing air quality, and higher marginal benefit of reductions of TSPs in communities with relatively low pollution levels. Surprisingly, negative amenity values of improved air quality are found in the three distinctive clusters of east Virginia, west and central Texas, and southeast Montana. This unexpected result may be explained by worsening air quality with intensive economic growth, greater appreciation in housing prices in those regions, and/or missing variables reflecting regionally specialized economic growth.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Analysis of Electrical Activity of the Core Muscles Exposed to Whole-Body Vibrations While Driving a Tractor Trailer Using Electromyography device</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Mangavelli, Harini</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Lower back disorders are observed to be the most significant problem for most of the industrial workers who operate commercial vehicles. A person sitting can have 40% higher load on the lumbar spine than when standing. Human core muscles related to spinal movement respond to rapid potential motions related to external acceleration inputs of vibration in order to control body posture, the increased muscle tension can result in muscle fatigue. The over use of muscles, vibration exposure combined with dehydration of spine and long term seating can lead to lower back pain and axial discomfort to the drivers. Electromyography (EMG) is a technique used to monitor and analyze the electrical activation of the muscle.
It has been found that the human spine has a natural frequency of 4-8Hz for natural upper body motion caused by curvature motion for the human spine. Trucks have historically produced the critical frequency which resulted in spinal problems for drivers. The purpose of air-ride seats is to reduce the critical frequency amplitudes. Muscular tension can move the natural frequencies to higher level to evaluate the response of the muscle to the expanded acceleration levels in the range of the spinal natural frequency.
A Flex Comp Infinity device, Sonosens® monitor and accelerometers are mounted on the driver of the tractor trailer to collect EMG, ultrasound and acceleration data, respectively. Three testing trials are performed to examine the EMG data, which is correlated with the ultrasonic data and acceleration data collected during the tests. Standard data was collected on the driver using the standard commercial long hall tractor trailer on normal roads.
The main purpose of the current research is to collect and analyze the physiological activity of the Erector spinae, Gluteus medius and Rectus abdominis muscles that relate to the lower back disorders. Present thesis work also examines spinal motions of the human body when exposed to whole-body vibrations.
The study results show that the Erector spinae muscle activity is higher than that of Rectus abdominis and Gluteus medius muscles. Also the muscle fatigue on all the core muscles is observed to occur after 1hr 40 mins to 2 hr, and lasts for nearly 10 mins.The EMG results are compared to the acceleration and ultrasonic data, which were also collected during the test. It is observed that approximately 75% of the ultrasonic results and 60% of acceleration data correlate with EMG results. More accurate results can be expected if more tests are carried out. This research is highly useful to carry out further investigation in the areas of whole body vibration and the muscular response to reduce the level of excitation.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Subverting the Panopticon: Privacy in the Public Realm</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Collins, Stephen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The Panopticon, designed by Jeremy Bentham in 1787, is an architectural device based on isolation of people and surveillance -knowledge focused in places of power. The Panopticon was influential as an architectural paradigm, easily adapted to varied uses. Bentham as did other utilitarian eighteenth century philosophers believed the built environment could fabricate virtue.
The techniques of the Panopticon were applied to the central task of fabricating normality, rather than the peripheral task of rectifying abnormality. Michel Foucault brought the moral engineering to the fore and showed that it was put in place to conduct 'normatively self-disciplining subjects.' As normative control methods became more prevalent methods of privacy protection developed in parallel. The notion of sensibility the personal consciousness required to guarantee a preferred normative responseemerged as one method to ensure privacy and protect social appearances.
This thesis will develop a language for architecture analogous to sensibility. Just as all people remain ultimately unknowable, the thesis will highlight false truths hypocrisy, defiance and conformity and balance opposites. The vehicle used to explore the tenuous line of sensibility is a Planned Parenthood facility in Charleston, SC. The site is an abandon eighteenth century jail, which is representative of the eighteenth century prison reform movement. The ironic pairing of program and site, combined with the security concerns creates an opportunity to decipher the subtle language of subversion.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Analysis of Cavity Flow and The Effects of a Rod in Crossflow</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Loewen, Richard David</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Subsonic cavity flow tests of an L/D = 3.5 cavity, with three different diameter rods in crossflow, 1/8&quot;, 3/16&quot;, and 1/4&quot;, were conducted using the High Speed Wind Tunnel in the University of Tennessee Space Institute’s Gas Dynamic Laboratory. The average Mach number flow over the duration of the four phase testing sequence was 0.52, with a unit Reynolds number of 13.8 x 106. With the use of a dynamic pressure transducer and a laser PIV system, Spectral and Flow Visualization data was collected with aim of investigating the effect of the rods in crossflow on cavity flow. However, for reasons beyond the control of this investigation, a converging-diverging supersonic nozzle was used in place of a subsonic nozzle. As a result, the separated, or near separated, flow on the diverging side of the nozzle created a region of low kinetic energy flow approximately 5 mm above the floor of the tunnel test section. Despite the presence of this undesirable feature, the Baseline cavity, without a rod in crossflow, was found to resonate at 1413 Hz and produced an average peak amplitude tone of 148.7 dB SPL. The effect of placing different diameter rods in the crossflow was to reduce the amount, and intensity, of shear layer interactions, by helping to loft the flow over the trailing edge of the cavity. The best results were achieved with a 1/4&quot; diameter rod, which, on average, provided 15.1 dB SPL of acoustic suppression. It was concluded that the suppression observed in this particular experiment was the result of blockage and lofting effects, which helped the shear layer to span the length of the cavity and reduce the intensity of the shear layer interactions at the trailing edge.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mesotrione, a carotenoid biosynthesis inhibiting herbicide, was evaluated for its use in turfgrass systems. Experiments were conducted to evaluate smooth crabgrass (Digitaria ischaemum) control with preemergence applications of mesotrione plus prodiamine. Experiments evaluated the influence of application timing on the efficacy of mesotrione plus prodiamine combinations and compared mesotrione plus prodiamine to current preemergence and early-postemergence herbicide treatments used for control of crabgrass. Greenhouse studies were conducted to compare the effects of foliar, soil, and soil plus foliar application of mesotrione on yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus) and large crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis). Research was conducted in environmental growth rooms to investigate the effects of light intensity and temperature on perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and large crabgrass carotenoid composition following mesotrione application.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Accelerated Thermal Aging of Fe-Zeolite SCR Catalysts on an Engine Bench</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Foster, Adam Lamar</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx with urea/NH3 is a leading candidate to the impending more stringent emissions regulations for diesel engines. Currently, there is no consensus on the durability and the deactivation mechanisms associated with zeolite-based SCR catalysts, nor is there an established protocol for rapidly aging zeolite-based SCR catalysts that replicates the catalyst deactivation associated with field service. A 517 cc single-cylinder, naturally-aspirated direct injection (NA/DI) diesel engine is used to perform accelerated thermal aging on Fe-zeolite SCR catalysts. The engine is fitted with an exhaust aftertreatment system consisting of a DOC, a SCR catalyst and a DPF. Accelerated aging protocol established for the SCR catalyst utilizes high temperature exhaust gases during the active regeneration of the DPF. Accelerated aging is carried out at exhaust gas temperatures of 650, 750 and 850°C at the SCR inlet and at a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of approximately 40,000 h-1. The engine is maintained at 1500 rpm and supplemental fuel is injected upstream of the DOC to alter the temperature of the aftertreatment system. The aged Fe-zeolite SCR catalysts are evaluated for NOx performance in a bench-flow reactor and characterized by multiple surface characterization techniques for materials changes.
The NOx performance of the front sections of the engine-aged catalysts is severely degraded. BET surface area measurements of the engine-aged catalyst indicate a severe reduction of catalyst surface area in the front sections of the catalysts aged at 750 and 850°C. However, the catalyst aged at 650°C has a catalyst surface area similar to that of a fresh catalyst; thereby ruling out reduction of catalyst surface area as the sole cause of the catalyst deactivation seen in the front sections of the engine-aged catalysts. The similar shape of the NOx conversion profiles observed with these catalyst sections even at different aging temperatures indicates some type of catalyst poisoning; however, the cause of catalyst degradation in these catalyst sections is not identified in this investigation.
There is a good relationship between the NOx performance and catalyst aging temperature for the rear sections of the engine-aged catalysts – NOx performance decreases with increasing aging temperature. XRD patterns and NO oxidation experiments reveal evidence of zeolite dealumination in the engine-aged catalysts. BET surface area measurements show that catalyst surface area decreases with increasing aging temperature, which further supports the suggestion of zeolite dealumination as the cause of catalyst deactivation in the rear sections of the engine-aged catalysts.
A comparison between the engine-aged and field-aged catalysts is conducted to assess the validity of the implemented accelerated thermal aging protocol in replicating the aging conditions observed in the field-aged catalyst. Bench-flow reactor evaluation is used to determine the NOx performance of the engine-aged and field-aged catalysts, and in depth surface studies are used to determine the deactivation mechanisms associated with each type of catalyst aging. SEM micrographs and BET surface area measurements of the aged catalysts show that the deactivation mechanism associated with catalyst aging is primarily physical damage to the zeolite washcoat for both the field-aged and engine-aged catalysts. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction and NO oxidation experiments identify zeolite dealumination as the underlying cause of the washcoat degradation. Finally, BFR evaluation shows that the NOx performance of the catalyst aged at 750°C for approximately 50 hours compares very well to that of the field-aged catalyst with a service life of 3 years. It is concluded that accelerated thermal aging on the engine bench is successful in bringing about similar catalyst changes to those seen with the field-aged catalyst.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Food Expenditures away from Home by Type of Meal and by Facility.</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Liu, Miaoru</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Consumer expenditure on food away from home in the United States has grown substantially in recent decades. Changes in the food service system, increased complexity of family structure, and the food policies made by government agencies have continued to influence the marketing, distribution, retailing, and demand for food products and the food industry. This study explores consumption behavior on food away from home (FAFH) and determines the differentiated impacts of economic and demographic variables on FAFH by type of meal and by type of facility among different household types. Each of the two systems of expenditures is estimated with two alternative econometric procedures to accommodate censoring in the dependent variables: the trivariate Tobit estimator and the multivariate sample selection estimator. Data for this study come from the 2008 and 2009 Consumer Expenditure Surveys, the most recent U.S. national household expenditure surveys conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Joint statistical significance of error correlations among equations justifies estimation of the sample selection systems. The opposite marginal effects on probabilities and expenditure levels of some variables highlight the advantage of the sample selection system over the Tobit system. Segmentation of the sample by household types is also justified with formal statistical tests. The empirical results indicate that the effects of demographic and socioeconomic factors on FAFH consumption vary by type of meal and by type of facility. Income, work hours, race, education, geographical region, and household composition are important factors. Food stamps have no impact on FAFH for married couples without children and single parenthood has conflicting effects on probabilities and conditional levels of expenditures.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Hips Unsocketed, Names Changed</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Church, Austin L</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This collection of poems represents my work from the past two years. I experiment with a variety of forms and measures, though most of these poems are in free verse. Two images serves as a cipher for understanding them as a whole: a peach tree and a red fox. Every year, I would wait in anticipation for the hard green buds to appear on the peach tree in my backyard, then, for them to change color, swelling with sweetness. By the time the ones that escaped the frost and insects were ripe enough to eat, I had forgotten about them and was surprised to see them on the kitchen table or catch a glimpse of red or orange in the leaves. Poetry has become my way of holding up my life’s fruits, my memories, to the sun to see how they have ripened. This metaphorical process of waiting and the renewed sense of discovery that comes with the long-awaited harvest define my experience of writing poetry. The second image, a red fox, has come to signify for me spiritual awareness and encounters with God in unexpected places. I have often seen red foxes in unlikely places. Poetry, for me, is a movement towards a deeper understanding of God. Poetry is searching for shalom in the midst of alienation, severed relationships, and ruptured selves. In summary, I seek a balanced and honest treatment of human heart-terrain, open to all emotions and experiences, with the ultimate aim of participating in God’s work of redemption and restoration.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Radioisotopic Impurities in Promethium-147 Produced at the ORNL High Flux Isotope Reactor</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hinderer, James Howard</dc:creator>
<dc:description>There is an intense interest in the availability of radioactive isotopes that could be developed into nuclear batteries.  Promethium-147 is one of the isotopes of interest for use in nuclear batteries as well as in other compact low power applications.  Pm-147 is a pure beta (β-) emitter with a half-life of 2.62 years.  For this research, Pm-147 was produced from enriched Nd-146 via the neutron capture method in the Hydraulic Tube facility of HFIR at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
Radioisotopic impurities produced via the neutron capture method have significant effects on its potential final use for nuclear battery applications.  This research provides information on the co-production levels of the radioisotopic impurities in the samples containing Pm-147 and their effects on the required shielding.  Gamma spectroscopy analysis served as the primary method in the evaluation of the impurities. Previous research had identified the presence of these impurities but it had not studied them in detail.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Streamflow Reconstructions of Southern Appalachian (North Carolina) Headwater Gages Using Tree Rings</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Geren, James Tate</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Tree rings have been used as a proxy in reconstructing streamflow in the western U.S. for many years, but few reconstructions have been attempted in the eastern United States.  Clear limitations exist for streamflow reconstructions in the eastern U.S. compared to the western U.S., but value can be established as demonstrated in this research.  The primary goal of this research was to reconstruct streamflow using data from five headwater gages in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina.  These gages are located on the Valley River, the Oconaluftee River, the Nantahala River, the Little Tennessee River, and the Watauga River.  Tree-ring chronologies were used to reconstruct streamflow.  Tree-ring chronology predictors were selected using a seasonal correlation analysis.  Seasonal correlation analysis revealed May-June-July (MJJ) streamflow variability being highly correlated with tree-ring chronologies in the study region and vicinity.  Stepwise linear regression methods were used to reconstruct MJJ streamflow.  The reconstructions for the Valley, Oconaluftee, and Nantahala Rivers were considered acceptable reconstructions because the models explained approximately 50% of the total variance in historic period MJJ streamflow records.  These three streamflow reconstruction models have predictive skill indicated by a positive reduction of error (RE) values.  The root mean square error (RMSE) statistic was 11.5 million cubic meters (MCM) for the Valley River (26% of the mean reconstructed MJJ flow), 15.9 MCM for the Oconaluftee River (16% of the mean reconstructed MJJ flow), and 8.2 MCM for the Nantahala River (20% of the mean reconstructed MJJ flow).  Analysis of the reconstructed streamflow data for these three rivers revealed low flow periods from 1710 to 1712 at all three sites.  The research presented here shows the potential benefit of using tree-ring chronologies to reconstruct streamflow in the Tennessee Valley region by demonstrating the ability of proxy-based reconstructions to provide useful data beyond the instrumental record.  These useful data include identification of extreme wet or dry periods and oscillations in the historical reconstructions that are not visible in the instrumental data.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Transport of explosive residue surrogates in saturated porous media</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lavoie, Bethsheba</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Contamination of soils by munitions constituents is pervasive on Department of Defense operational ranges. Low-order detonations result in the heterogeneous distribution of explosives residues (ER) at shallow depths. At a limited number of ranges ER contamination of groundwater has been observed.
Previous studies have shown that the downward migration of colloid-sized contaminants can significantly impact groundwater quality. The goal of this study was to investigate if colloid transport plays a role in the migration of ER contaminants. Our primary objective was to determine the transport potential of fine (&lt;5&gt;um) ER particles under ideal conditions for colloid transport. A secondary objective was to develop a direct detection method for the identification and quantitative analysis of particulate ER.
A series of saturated transport experiments were conducted in columns (2x20 cm) packed with clean sand. 2,6- Dinitrotoluene was used as a surrogate for explosives chemicals. Experiments were conducted with both particulate and dissolved-phase DNT. Bromide and microspheres tracers were also used to characterize nonreactive transport. Particulate tracers were applied to the columns, either suspended in the influent solution, or directly to the top layer of sand, in order to more realistically replicate field conditions. Experimental results indicate that DNT movement through the columns occurred as a combination of solid and dissolved phase transport. Concentration differences between unfiltered and filtered samples indicate that particulate DNT accounted up to 30% of the total mass recovered in the effluent.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Performance Analysis of a Rocket Based Combined Cycle (RBCC) Propulsion System for Single-Stage-To-Orbit Vehicle Applications</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Williams, Nehemiah Joel</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Rocket-Based Combined Cycle (RBCC) engines combine the best performance characteristics of air-breathing systems such as ramjets and scramjets with rockets with the goal of increasing payload/structure and propellant performance and thus making LEO more readily accessible. The idea of using RBCC engines for Single-Stage-To-Orbit (SSTO) trans-atmospheric acceleration is not new, but has been known for decades. Unfortunately, the availability of detailed models of RBCC engines is scarce. This thesis addresses the issue through the construction of an analytical performance model of an ejector rocket in a dual combustion propulsion system (ERIDANUS) RBCC engine. This performance model along with an atmospheric model, created using MATLAB was designed to be a preliminary `proof-of-concept' which provides details on the performance and behavior of an RBCC engine in the context of use during trans-atmospheric acceleration, and also to investigate the possibility of improving propellant performance above that of conventional rocket powered systems. ERIDANUS behaves as a thrust augmented rocket in low speed flight, as a ramjet in supersonic flight, a scramjet in hypersonic flight, and as a pure rocket near orbital speeds and altitudes.
A simulation of the ERIDANUS RBCC engine's flight through the atmosphere in the presence of changing atmospheric conditions was performed. The performance code solves one-dimensional compressible flow equations while using the stream thrust control volume method at each station component (e.g. diffuser, burner, and nozzle) in all modes of operation to analyze the performance of the ERIDANUS RBCC engine. Plots of the performance metrics of interest including specific impulse, specific thrust, thrust specific fuel consumption, and overall efficiency were produced. These plots are used as a gage to measure the behavior of the ERIDANUS propulsion system as it accelerates towards LEO. A mission averaged specific impulse of 1080 seconds was calculated from the ERIDANUS code, reducing the required propellant mass to 65%  of the gross lift off weight (GLOW), thus increasing the mass available for the payload and structure to 35% of the GLOW.
Validation of the ERIDANUS RBCC concept was performed by comparing it with other known RBCC propulsion models. Good correlation exists between the ERIDANUS model and the other models. This indicates that the ERIDANUS RBCC is a viable candidate propulsion system for a one-stage trans-atmospheric accelerator.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Horticultural Therapy in Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Pfeffer, Jenny Cecilia</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of the study was conducted to identify the existing HT programs in Tennessee and to locate the types of institutions, staff, activities, and clientele involved in those programs. Horticulture as a therapeutic medium is increasing rapidly, especially in the U.S., and there is a significant need to compile information about available programs in Tennessee. The Web-Survey of Horticultural Therapy Programs in Tennessee was developed and used in spring 2007 to survey members of the Tennessee Hospital Association, the Tennessee Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, the Tennessee Master Gardeners; the Manager of Knoxville Sertoma Center Greenhouse; the directors of Cheekwood Botanic Garden, Nashville, Ijams Nature Center, Knoxville, and the Memphis Botanic Garden. The estimated population for this survey was 1,314 (=N) participants. Two hundred eighty four people started to take the survey and 198 of those completed it successfully. These participants were a little-to somewhat familiar with the use of horticulture as a tool for therapy.
The results of the survey indicated there are at least 12 (=n) HT programs in Tennessee. The study showed that each horticultural therapy program was individualized depending on the type of client served, the type of funding of the institution, and the resources available for the horticultural therapy program. The survey found that the main purpose of the HT programs in Tennessee was to “improve mood” of their clients, following by “social interaction,” “stress reduction” and “motor skill development.” Ninety-one percent of respondents felt there was a need for an association in Tennessee, and 86% felt that there was a need for professional HT in Tennessee.
A restive-healing garden was designed at the Parkwest Medical Center, Knoxville. The multi-use rooftop garden was designed for patients and staff to provide feelings of security in a home-like deck environment where patients might receive individual and/or group recreational therapy, physical therapy, and horticultural therapy; provide opportunities to relieve tension, frustration and aggression; provide opportunities for reflection, relaxation and privacy for staff and patients; provide opportunities for different social and recreational activities; and provide stimulation of the senses with color, smells, textures, and sound.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Empress' Story</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Yates, Brandy Michelle</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Empress' Story is a creative thesis written by Brandy Michelle Yates in partial fulfillment of the Master of Arts in English degree. Empress' Story explores four days in Empress' adolescent life in which her best friend, Roni, is raped by a deacon in the church they both attend. Empress' Story is not a coming-of-age story; instead, it focuses upon race, gender, rape, and religion in a small Southern town. The way the town handles the rape of Roni is an example of the social context and stigma that surround the deeply personal actualization of people and their actions. This thesis looks to explore the deeply intricate complexities of the nature of humanity.</dc:description>
