			<dc:title>A proteomic investigation of &lt;em&gt;Phytophthora&lt;/em&gt; species using mass spectrometry and reverse genetics</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Savidor, Alon</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Organisms in the genus Phytophthora are important plant pathogens, although understudied. Phytophthora was first brought into human awareness with the identification of P. infestans as the culprit for the Irish potato famine in the mid 1800s. Since then, over 80 Phytophthora species have been identified, many of which infect a wide variety of crops worldwide with devastating results.
Traditionally, much of the work aimed at controlling Phytophthora diseases involved applied research. In recent years there has been a marked increase in molecular work on Phytophthora. This increase is evident not only from increased funding by agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), but also from the type of research applied to Phytophthora for the first time. The first Phytophthora species to have their genomes sequenced were P. sojae and P. ramorum at 2004. Since then the genomes of two more Phytophthora species- P. capsici and P. infestans, were also sequenced.
Availability of Phytophthora genome sequences provided us with the basis necessary for a proteomic investigation of these organisms. The study presented here represents the first large scale proteomic study of any Phytophthora species. Using mass spectrometry and available or newly developed bioinformatic tools we measured the proteomes of different asexual Phytophthora life stages. We also measured the protein complement of P. capsici infected tomato plants, the so called “interactome”, in order to gain an insight into the biological processes occurring in the pathogen during infection, and in the plant in response to the pathogen. We also used data from these proteomic experiments as a part of a novel approach aimed at improving the genome annotation of those Phytophthora species. Finally, we used different molecular techniques, including a reverse genetic technique called Targeted Induced Local Lesions in Genome (TILLING), to begin characterization of a few protein targets identified in those experiments.
The accumulated data from all our experiments identified certain molecular processes, metabolic and others, that may explain the success of Phytophthora as a plant pathogen. The data from these experiments provides a platform on which future experiments can be based on to further characterize these interesting organisms.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Evolution and Mechanics of Translational Control in Plants</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Vaughn, Justin N.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The expression of numerous plant mRNAs is attenuated by RNA sequence elements located in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs).  For example, in plants and many higher eukaryotes, roughly 35% of genes encode mRNAs that contain one or more upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the 5' UTR.  For this dissertation I have analyzed the pattern of conservation of such mRNA sequence elements. In the first set of studies, I have taken a comparative transcriptomics approach to address which RNA sequence elements are conserved between various families of angiosperm plants.  Such conservation indicates an element's fundamental importance to plant biology, points to pathways for which it is most vital, and suggests the mechanism by which it acts.  Conserved motifs were detected in 3% of genes.  These include di-purine repeat motifs, uORF-associated motifs, putative binding sites for PUMILIO-like RNA binding proteins, small RNA targets, and a wide range of other sequence motifs.  Due to the scanning process that precedes translation initiation, uORFs are often translated, thereby repressing initiation at the an mRNA's main ORF.  As one might predict, I found a clear bias against the AUG start codon within the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) among all plants examined.  Further supporting this finding, comparative analysis indicates that, for ~42% of genes, AUGs and their resultant uORFs reduce carrier fitness. Interestingly, for at least 5% of genes, uORFs are not only tolerated, but enriched.  The remaining uORFs appear to be neutral.  Because of their tangible impact on plant biology, it is critical to differentiate how uORFs affect translation and how, in many cases, their inhibitory effects are neutralized.  In pursuit of this aim, I developed a computational model of the initiation process that uses five parameters to account for uORF presence.  In vivo translation efficiency data from uORF-containing reporter constructs were used to estimate the model's parameters in wild type Arabidopsis.  In addition, the model was applied to identify salient defects associated with a mutation in the subunit h of eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3h).  The model indicates that eIF3h, by supporting re-initation during uORF elongation, facilitates uORF tolerance.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Beyond Sharing the Pen: Dialogue in the Context of Interactive Writing</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Jordan, Jennifer Jeanne</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this design study was to examine how two teachers revise their instructional methods in response to student outcomes and how students learn strategies of writing through classroom discourse in the context of interactive writing. The study was designed to explore the role of teacher and student in socially situated writing environments and reveal how conversation affects student learning and instructional decision-making. Throughout the study I was an active participant observer continually modifying the intervention with the input of the classroom teachers.
This study was based on the theoret ical model of reading as a meaning-construction process described by Ruddell and Unrau (2004). According to this model, the reader, or in this case the writer, the text, and the teacher negotiate meaning within the social setting of the classroom. Two first grade classrooms served as the bounded units of analysis for this case study with an emphasis on formative experiment. Data collected included classroom observations and transcripts, transcripts of afterschool planning and reflecting meetings, transcripts of teacher and student interviews, teacher reflection logs, written artifacts, and student assessments. Data analysis was based on Wells‟ (1999) progressive discourse analysis. Progressive discourse refers to the process of building knowledge through conversation. Dialogue is a tool used to gain new knowledge and modify existing knowledge.
The two participating teachers in this study were able to revise their instructional methods based on the individual needs of their students to varying degrees. The students in the more successful teacher‟s classroom had more significant academic gains in reading and writing by the end of the intervention. The findings from this study suggest that it is important to understand the prior beliefs of teachers, their knowledge of the reciprocal relationship between reading and writing, and their preferred avenues of reflection when attempting to implement an interactive writing intervention. For student learning outcomes it may be important to consider the need for explicit literacy instruction, interactive dialogic moves, student engagement, and the opportunity for students to take on the role of teacher to their peers</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Cognitive Prototypes of the Mentor and Protégé Roles</dc:title>
<dc:creator>McManus, Stacy</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Organizational mentoring is associated with positive events and experiences for protégés, mentors, and their organizations. Research on what makes those relationships successful – and potentially replicable with formal programs – has looked at the structure of the mentorship (e.g., formal vs. informal), the demographic make up of the mentoring dyad (e.g., race, gender), and attitudinal similarity between the mentor and protégé. Generally, results have been mixed and it appears that these factors do not account for a great deal of mentorship success. Cognitive prototypes of the mentor and protégé roles may be one as yet unexplored factor that might help us better understand successful mentorships. Since no research to date has been conducted in this area, the current study investigates the nature of those cognitive prototypes by identifying their content, examining the extent to which these prototypes may be gender-typed, and how prior mentoring experiences might be related to prototype gender-typing. Results suggest that strong performance and high potential are important aspects of the prototypical protégé, and that elements of organizational power and interpersonal skills are important aspects of the prototypical mentor. There was no evidence of prototype gender-typing. Implications for research and practice also are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Double-Edged Sword of Self-Enhancement: A Longitudinal Examination of the Effects of Self-Enhancement on Psychological and Physical Well-Being among Individuals with Multiple Sclerosis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>O'Mara, Erin Marie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The present study prospectively examines factors that affect whether self-enhancement exerts favorable or unfavorable effects on both psychological and physical well-being in a context that is less controllable than other contexts in which self-enhancement has been examined (e.g., academic performance), an at risk population of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. In particular, the present study (a) examines whether self-enhancement differentially predicts psychological and physical well-being when self-enhancement is related or unrelated to the well-being outcomes, and (b) whether self-enhancement interacts with severity of circumstances (i.e., course of MS) to predict psychological and physical well-being, as suggested by O’Mara, McNulty, &amp; Karney (2011). In addition to the baseline assessment, participants completed measures of self-enhancement (outcome-related and outcome-unrelated), and psychological and physical well-being every 30 days for 90 days, for a total of four assessments. The pattern of findings suggests that in less controllable contexts, self-enhancement is a doubled-edged sword. Outcome-related self-enhancement was trending towards a positive, cross-sectionally association with physical well-being, and a measure of prior outcome-unrelated self-enhancement (collectivistic tactical self-enhancement) was positively associated with subsequent physical well-being only for individuals with less severe MS. Further, prior outcome-related self-enhancement was associated with better subsequent psychological well-being but worse subsequent physical well-being, and although prior collectivistic tactical self-enhancement is associated with favorable subsequent physical well-being for individuals with less severe MS, it is also associated unfavorable psychological well-being regardless of MS severity. The discussion addresses the contributions of the present study to the literature, strengths and limitations of the present study, and directions for future research.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Consumer Participation in Using Online Product Recommendation Agents: Effects of Trust, PerceivedControl, and Perceived Risk in Providing Personal Information</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sheng, Xiaojing</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Online product recommendation agents are gaining greater strategic importance as an innovative technology to deliver value-added services to consumers. Yet the active role of consumers as the participants in using this technology is not well understood. This dissertation builds on the technology-based self-service (TBSS) literature, consumer participation literature, the service-dominant logic, and the trust literature on recommendation agents to develop a research framework that explains the role of consumer participation in using online product recommendation agents.
The objective of this dissertation is three-fold: (1) to examine the effects of consumer participation and privacy/security disclosures in using online product recommendation agents, (2) to explore the mediating effects of trust, perceived control, and perceived risk in providing personal information, and (3) to test the trust transference process within the current research context.
A field experiment using existing recommendation agents was conducted with multiple sessions in computer labs to collect data from university students, a representative sample of the online population. 67 undergraduate students participated in the pretest, and 117 participated in the main study. Structural equation modeling with AMOS 7.0 was used to test the research hypotheses.
The results showed that consumer participation was a contributing factor in building consumers’ trust in recommendation agents and that privacy/security disclosures decreased consumers’ perceived risk in providing personal information. Moreover, the trust transference process was validated among the three different types of consumer trust within the agent-mediated environment, that is, trust in the recommendation agent, trust in the Web site, and trust in recommendations. Finally, perceived control was shown to be a salient factor in increasing consumers’ trust and motivating consumers to reuse the recommendation technology</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Study of Middle School Teachers' Use of Assessment Team Data from Learning Disability Evaluations</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Witt, Carole Cavender</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to examine teacher usage of assessment data from learning disability evaluations received in multidisciplinary team/individualized educational plan (MDT/IEP) meetings. Teacher perception of the helpfulness and usefulness of different types of assessment data, and the helpfulness of different types of data compared to each other were focuses of the study. Effects of teacher characteristics such as type of training received, amount of training received, and the amount of experience possessed on the level of teacher usage of assessment data were analyzed. Effects of teacher participation in referral procedures for students with suspected learning disabilities and participation in MDT/IEP meetings on the level of usage of assessment data were also analyzed. Study participants included 133 teachers and school psychologists currently employed in a middle school setting in the state of Tennessee. This study was primarily descriptive in design; statistical methods used were t-tests, ANOVAs, and the Spearman’s Rho correlation.
Results indicated that teachers found the assessment data they received in MDT/IEP meetings to be significantly helpful (t = 10.797, p &lt; .001) and useful (t = 7.2, p &lt; .001) in identifying students’ needs and designing instruction. There was a significant difference in teacher perception of the helpfulness of different types of assessment data in linking to instruction. While special education teachers found the types of data to be almost equally helpful (F (4, 19) =. 141, p = .965), results for regular education teachers indicated a significant difference for classroom observations (F(4, 76) = 4.443, p = .003). Results also indicated a weak positive correlation between years of teaching experience and the level of usage of assessment data (rs = .209, p = .029). Finally, attendance at MDT/IEP meetings was shown to have a significant effect on the level of teacher usage of assessment data (F (1, 82) = 7.704, p = .006).
It was concluded that teachers and school psychologists should consider whether current assessment practices provide linkage to instruction when choosing assessment instruments and interpreting the data they produce. Implications for university training programs and directions for future research are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Geographic Variation and Phenotypic Plasticity of Body Size and Cell Size in the Lizard, Anolis Carolinensis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Goodman, Rachael</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Patterns of geographic variation in body size and cell size have long fascinated biologists, and climatic variables have often been considered to explain such patterns. Environmental temperature can profoundly influence the phenotype, including body size. of ectotherms, and reptiles in particular. This dissertation presents four studies that examine how temperature shapes morphology on developmental and evolutionary timescales in the green anole lizard, Anolis carolinensis. The first three studies examined variation in and phenotypic plasticity of cell size and body size through laboratory experiments using eggs and juveniles from wild-caught females in five populations of A. carolinensis. The fourth study examined geographic variation in body size and cell size in 19 wild populations across the species range. Temperature-induced plasticity in cell size but not initial hatching size was demonstrated. However, subsequent differences in growth rates among juveniles reared in a common laboratory environment indicated a latent effect of incubation temperature on body size. Sampling of body size and red blood cell size from four eastern populations in the range suggested a latitudinal trend in body size and cell size. Rearing of offspring in a common environment indicated differences among populations in juvenile and, potentially, embryonic growth rates contributing to divergence in adult body size. Extended sampling of body size and cell size from 19 populations throughout the range, however, showed that inclusion of Florida populations heavily skewed geographic patterns because of the smaller body and cell size of anoles in the peninsular state. Exclusion of these populations revealed a negative relationship between latitude and both body size and muscle cell size, and no geographic trends in red blood cell size.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Sociality, Cognition and Social Learning in Turtles (Emydidae)</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Davis, Karen Marie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Turtles are little studied with respect to learning, cognition and social behavior in spite of being phylogenetically a central group. Populations of many species of these long-lived animals are declining due to commercial activities (pet trade and food), pollution, and habitat destruction. This integrative study of freshwater turtle (Emydidae) behavior investigated their sociality, individual learning and memory capabilities, and the ability of turtles to learn from others.
First, I studied turtle underwater social behavior which involved naturalistic observations and ethogram development of the underwater social behavior of (Family Emydidae) at the Chattanooga Aquarium. Turtle social behavioral repertoire and interaction sequencing while underwater were much more complex and varied than those recorded for turtle basking interactions. Turtles also formed stable dominance hierarchies.
Second, I trained and tested 9 Florida Red-bellied Cooters (Pseudemys nelsoni) in a discrimination choice task that I developed. Turtles were first trained to an instrumental response task (dislodging clear plastic bottles to obtain food pellets). These turtles not only showed rapid learning, but required minimal to no retraining after a period of 2 years. This study marks the first time that turtles have been shown to exhibit extensive long-term memory measured in years in a controlled experimental task. Olfactory and other controls were run to confirm that the turtles were responding only to visual cues.
Finally, I investigated whether turtles could learn about a visual object cue to obtain food reinforcement by observing other experienced turtles that had learned the task. All five P. nelsoni turtles tested showed evidence of social facilitation and stimulus enhancement learning i.e. they learned not only to follow another turtle to a stimulus indicating food but also to approach the correct bottle that contained food reinforcement. This is the first experimental study of social learning in turtles.
This integrative study of social behavior, learning, and cognition of turtles will hopefully spark interest in turtle behavior and cognition, help advance the field of comparative animal cognition, and aid in the development of their management in the wild.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Statistical and Machine Learning Techniques Applied to Algorithm Selection for Solving Sparse Linear Systems</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Fuentes, Erika</dc:creator>
<dc:description>There are many applications and problems in science and engineering that require large-scale numerical simulations and computations. The issue of choosing an appropriate method to solve these problems is very common, however it is not a trivial one, principally because this decision is most of the times too hard for humans to make, or certain degree of expertise and knowledge in the particular discipline, or in mathematics, are required. Thus, the development of a methodology that can facilitate or automate this process and helps to understand the problem, would be of great interest and help. The proposal is to utilize various statistically based machine-learning and data mining techniques to analyze and automate the process of choosing an appropriate numerical algorithm for solving a specific set of problems (sparse linear systems) based on their individual properties.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Taking Off: The Politics and Culture of American Aviation, 1920-1939</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Johnson, McMillan Houston, V</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Historians have traditionally emphasized the sharp differences between Herbert Hoover’s vision of an associational state and the activism of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal. This dissertation highlights an important area of continuity between the economic policies espoused by Hoover—during his tenures as Secretary of Commerce and President—and Roosevelt, focusing on federal efforts to promote the nascent aviation industry from the end of World War I until the passage of the Civil Aeronautics Act in 1938. These efforts were successful, and offer a unique arena in which to document the concrete gains wrought by Hoover’s associationalist ideology and Roosevelt’s New Deal. Moreover, both Hoover’s corporatist policies and New Deal efforts to create aviation infrastructure—largely through the auspices of public works agencies like the Public Works Administration and Works Progress Administration—form a striking example of the government’s ability to successfully foster the development of a new industry, even in the midst of the Great Depression. Significantly, both men’s efforts represented an alternative to nationalization, the path taken by virtually every European nation during the era. This period thus offers the opportunity to examine how both presidents’ aviation policies cohere with their larger visions of government’s proper relationship to the economy, to compare and contrast associationalism and New Deal, and to elucidate aviation’s role in promoting American economic development.  During these years government actions expanded from having literally no engagement with commercial aviation to subsidizing airmail routes, creating a regulatory infrastructure to promote safe operations by licensing pilots, inspecting aircraft, approving manufacturing operations, and aggressively promoting flying to the American people. Contextualized by the American public’s well-documented enthusiasm for flying—particularly after Charles Lindbergh’s famous New York-to-Paris flight in 1927—these federal actions created America’s modern air transport network, culminating in the passage of the seminal Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, the construction and improvement of almost a thousand airports around the country, and the growth of a core group of airlines, including United, Delta, and American, that still dominate commercial flying today.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Identification and Description of the Reasons Provided by Soldiers for Reenlisting in the U. S. Army Medical Department</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Coe, Thomas Ray</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The retention of healthcare personnel, especially in the profession of nursing, continues to remain a critical issue. The ability to adequately and safely staff healthcare facilities to provide inpatient and outpatient care and emergency services is dependent on maintaining a well trained and experienced professional and paraprofessional workforce. This issue is of particular importance to the enlisted members of United States Army Medical Department (AMEDD) and the United States Army Nurse Corps. This qualitative descriptive research study identified many topics influencing the retention of enlisted personnel in the AMEDD.
The work environment, economic factors, personal and professional issues were identified as influencing decisions regarding reenlistment. Additionally, the findings of this study indicate that the decision to reenlist was often made as a result of the individual’s perceptions and evaluation of the importance and interactions of the topics. Finally, this study identified that retention can also include the possibility of staff returning to a previous employer. The development of a better understanding of the topics identified and described as important when making the decision to reenlist should support the AMEDD as it continues to assess and refine current reenlistment incentives as well as the identification and development of additional options to improve enlisted soldier retention.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Visual Approach to Automated Text Mining and Knowledge Discovery</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Puretskiy, Andrey A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The focus of this dissertation has been on improving the non-negative tensor factorization technique of text mining. The improvements have been made in both pre-processing and post-processing stages, with the goal of making the non-negative tensor factorization algorithm accessible to the casual user. The improved implementation allows the user to construct and modify the contents of the tensor, experiment with relative term weights and trust measures, and experiment with the total number of algorithm output features. Non-negative tensor factorization output feature production is closely integrated with a visual post-processing tool, FutureLens, that allows the user to perform in depth analysis and has a great potential for discovery of interesting and novel patterns within a large collection of textual data. This dissertation necessitated a number of significant modifications and additions to FutureLens in order to facilitate its integration into the analysis environment.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Interplay between structure and chemistry of materials and their physical properties</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Subedi, Alaska</dc:creator>
<dc:description>First principles calculations provide a powerful tool for sorting out the interplay of chemical composition and structure with the physical properties of materials. In this dissertation, I discuss the physical properties and their microscopic basis within this framework for following illustrative examples. (i) The Zintl phase hydrides, where I find H is anionic and the formation of covalent sp2 bonds in the Al/Ga/Al-Si planes, which is a highly unusual bonding configuration for these elements. (ii) PbTe, which shows strong coupling between the longitudinal acoustic and transverse optic modes that may explain its low thermal conductivity. (iii) The double perovskites BiPbZnNbO6 and BiSrZnNbO6, where introducing size disorder at A-site prevents the BO6 octahedra from tiling and enhances the polar behavior. (iv) FeSe, which shares the salient electronic and magnetic features of other Fe superconductors and cannot be described as a conventional electron phonon superconductor. (v) NbFe2, which is near a magnetic quantum critical point and shows strong competition between various magnetic orderings that may explain its unusual non-Fermi liquid behavior at very low temperatures. (vi) The nickel analogues of Fe superconductors LaNiPO and BaNi2As2, where I show that superconductivity is of conventional electron-phonon type in contrast to the Fe-based superconductors. (vii) Noncentrosymmetric LaNiC2, which I find is a conventional electron-phonon superconductor with intermediate coupling.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Application of the Western Hemisphere Health Index to Prehistoric Populations from Tennessee and the Semi-arid North of Chile: A Comparative Bioarchaeological Study of the Implications of Subsistence Choice</dc:title>
<dc:creator>DiGangi, Elizabeth A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The Western Hemisphere Health Index was applied to prehistoric contemporaneous skeletal populations from Tennessee and the semi-arid North of Chile to ascertain four things: 1. overall health status for each culture; 2. comparison of health status between contemporaneous cultures; 3. if subsistence change (i.e., transition from gathering-hunting to agriculture) is consistently accompanied by a decline in overall health; and 4. the utility of the health index methodology. The skeletal populations analyzed from the semi-arid North of Chile were Archaic (7730 B.C. – A.D. 245) and Diaguita (A.D. 1000 – 1536). Prehistoric individuals examined from Tennessee were Archaic (8000 – 1000 B.C.); Woodland (1000 B.C. – A.D. 1000); and Mississippian (A.D. 1000 – 1600). (Total n = 433 individuals). Both Archaic populations had primarily a gathering and hunting subsistence strategy, Woodland peoples were emerging horticulturalists, and Mississippian and Diaguita populations practiced full-scale agriculture.
As per health index methodology, seven indicators of health were scored (stature, linear enamel hypoplasia, dental disease, anemia, infection, degenerative joint disease, and trauma). Health index statistical methodology and Pearson chi-square were used to test the proposed hypotheses. Results indicated that the Archaic Tennessee population had the lowest health index value, and both Chilean populations had the highest. The results of the chi-square analyses run on each of the health indicators by population were in tandem with the health index results. In Tennessee, health appeared to improve through time; while in Chile, health essentially stayed the same during the subsistence transition.
Such results suggest that the hypothesis of a health decline during and after subsistence change to agriculture is not always demonstrated. These findings further indicate that general rules regarding the association between health and subsistence change do not exist. Rather than applying generalizations to populations, research should focus on the specific situation of each population (environment, subsistence, socio-political organization, etcetera) followed by a comparison between populations to reveal similarities and differences. Such analyses will assist with identifying the relative importance of particular factors for each site.
The utility of the health index methodology was also discussed. The index is a useful tool for population comparison, though further refinement of the methodological protocol is warranted.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Rawlsian Case for Public Judgment</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Deaton, Justin Matthew</dc:creator>
<dc:description>We can best understand the moral obligations of citizens and officials concerning public reason as set out by John Rawls when two differing standards latent in his body of work are made explicit. The weaker standard, which I call Public Representation (or PR), is exegetically supported primarily by the proviso found in his “The Idea of Public Reason Revisited”. PR allows that citizens may deliberate over serious political matters, both internally and with others, according to whatever perspective and using whatever reasons they please, so long as they believe the positions they advocate are adequately just and adequately justifiable with public reasons. I present PR as establishing a moral minimum citizens and officials bear an obligation to satisfy on pain of failing to garner an adequate degree of justice, respect, legitimacy, and stability.
The more demanding standard, which I call Public Judgment (or PJ), is exegetically supported by quotes found throughout Rawls’s work, but especially in Political Liberalism, “The Idea of Public Reason Revisited,” and Justice as Fairness: A Restatement. PJ requires that citizens deliberate over serious political matters, both internally and with others, according to a public perspective with public reasons, that they only advocate positions and offer justifications they consider most reasonable, and that they share their thought processes in public. PR is nonobligatory, but achieves significant gains according to each of the four key political values mentioned above, which gives dedicated citizens good reason to embrace it.
Chapter one lays out and explores the big picture concepts framing the project; chapter two sets out Rawls’s view on public reason according to the primary texts; chapter three presents four contemporary liberal theorists’ views on public reason – Nicholas Wolterstorff, Robert Audi, David Reidy, and Micah Schwartzman; chapter four uses the lessons of chapter three to help fully unpack and compare Public Representation and Public Judgment; and chapter five considers three potential objections to my view and offers corresponding replies.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>LOCALLY PRODUCED FOOD PURCHASING THROUGH RETAIL GROCERY CHANNELS: AN EVALUATION OF RELEVANT CUSTOMER AND STORE ENVIRONMENT ATTRIBUTES</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Campbell, Jeffrey Michael</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The study examines the phenomenon of purchasing locally produced foods in retail grocery stores. Theoretical foundations from the theory of planned behavior and from the stimulus-organism-response framework were used to support and test a model that hypothesized relationships between attitude, subjective norms, perceived consumer effectiveness, perceived product availability, intention to purchase, store atmospheric responsiveness, price consciousness, and extent of purchase behavior in a retail grocery setting.
An online survey methodology was used to collect 600 responses across the United States. A two-step approach to structural equation modeling was used to test the relationships. Confirmatory factor analysis with measurement model development supported the hypotheses of store atmospheric responsiveness as a multidimensional construct reflected in four specific dimensions (1) product assortment responsiveness, (2) display factors responsiveness, (3) customer service responsiveness, and (4) store promotions responsiveness. The construct of perceived consumer effectiveness (PCE) was found to highly correlate with attitude and PCE was subsequently dropped as an independent latent construct.
Results from analysis of the fitted structural model indicated that attitude and perceived product availability were significant positive indicators of intention to purchase, while subjective norms indicated a significant negative relationship to intention to purchase. A significant positive direct effect between intention to purchase and extent of purchase and a significant positive indirect effect through that of store atmospheric responsiveness was found, suggesting that store atmospheric responsiveness partially mediates the relationship. Consumer price consciousness was found to not significantly moderate the relationship between intention to purchase and extent of purchase. From the results, academic and managerial implications were suggested. For future research directions, four distinct categories emerged; they included (1) a focus on store atmospherics, specifically store atmospheric responsiveness when shopping for locally produced foods, (2) analysis of group differences between shoppers of locally produced foods, (3) category analysis of locally produced food items, and (4) research on the pricing of locally produced foods.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Clayton, Timothy Joseph</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This research considers the application of Optimal Control theory to minimize the spread of viral infections in disease models. The population models under consideration are systems of ordinary differential equations and represent epidemics arising due to either rabies or West Nile virus. Optimal control strategies are analyzed using Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle and illustrated based upon computer simulations.
The first model describes a population of raccoons and its interaction with the rabies virus, thus dividing the animals into four classes: susceptible, exposed, immune, and recovered (SEIR). The model includes a birth pulse during the spring of the year and an equation reflecting the dynamics of a potential vaccine. The vaccine equation contains a linear control variable representing the rate at which the vaccine is distributed. The goal is to minimize the number of infected raccoons and the cost of vaccine distributed. Due to linearity in the control, there is the possibility of a singular control and the generalized Legendre-Clebsch condition will be satisfied to obtain new necessary conditions for the singular case. A scenario with a limited amount of vaccine is also investigated. The system is modified to include a density-dependent death rate for each of the S, E, I, R classes, and the results of this model are compared with those of the non-density dependent model to determine how the different death rates affect control strategies.
The second disease model considered describes the dynamics of mosquito, bird and human populations exposed to the West Nile virus. The mosquito and bird categories will be divided into susceptible and infected classes. In addition to these two groups, humans will also have the potential of entering the exposed, hospitalized and recovered classes. In this model, birth and death rates are assumed to be density-dependent. Two controls are applied with one control representing pesticide efforts to decrease the number of mosquitos and a second control representing prevention and repellant methods. The basic reproduction number is considered to justify the need for control.
Approximations of the optimal solutions of the models are obtained using an iterative method. The numerical algorithm, Runge-Kutta of order four, is programmed in Matlab. Graphical results show the appropriate amount of control for various situations.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Into the Attic: A Novel</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Koons, Laura E</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This creative dissertation is a novel titled Into the Attic.  The novel tells the story of Sullivan Young, a junior at a small liberal arts college in central Pennsylvania in the mid-2000s, and James Shelley, a young literature professor at the college, with whom Sullivan initiates an affair.  The narrative switches between the points of view of these two men, neither of whom is happy with the person he is becoming, and develops around the fears each has about the relationship.
The novel is concerned with character, sexuality, and power; in order to explore these issues fully within Sullivan and Shelley’s relationship, the novel alternates between the two characters’ points of view, thus attempting to illustrate the way the negotiation of power in the relationship also alternates between them as the relationship develops.  The novel relies heavily on Sullivan’s and Shelley’s experiences as gay men and uses explicit sex scenes to develop character; therefore, my critical introduction examines the implications of writing a political or social “other” and references writers and critics—such as Dorothy Allison, Wayne Booth, Tillie Olsen, Jacqueline Jones Royster, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, and Calvin Thomas—who have informed my understanding of writing “the other.”</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Deciphering Climate from the Characterization of Ring Width, Carbon, and Oxygen Isotopes in Latewood Tree-Ring Cellulose, Big Thicket National Preserve, Texas, USA</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lewis, Daniel Bruce</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Trees are excellent archives of paleoclimatic information. They can preserve records of past temperature, precipitation, drought, and extreme weather events. The focus of this dissertation is to use tree ring width, carbon isotopes, oxygen isotopes from multiple trees to characterize climate variability and the tree-ring tropical cyclone record. Living longleaf pine trees (Pinus palustris Mill.) were sampled from the Turkey Creek and Big Sandy Creek Units at Big Thicket National Preserve, Texas. Annual tree rings were measured and assigned yearly calendar dates. The latewood portion of each annual ring was shaved with a scalpel, and alpha-cellulose was extracted for carbon and oxygen isotopic analyses. Oxygen isotope records from both sites indicated that individual trees growing in the same stands could vary significantly from each other. The heterogeneity of tree-ring oxygen isotopes was driven by variability in the oxygen isotope composition of soil moisture used for tree growth. Average oxygen isotope chronologies from both sites yielded significant correlations with regional fall (August–October) precipitation (Turkey Creek r = –0.71, p &lt; 0.001; Big Sandy Creek r = –0.62, p &lt; 0.001) and z-index (Turkey Creek r = –0.69, p &lt; 0.001; Big Sandy Creek r = –0.63, p &lt; 0.001). An average carbon isotope chronology from Big Sandy Creek was also significantly correlated with fall precipitation (r = – 0.59, p &lt; 0.001) and z-index (r = –0.57, p &lt; 0.001). Individual trees at both sites did not always record similar tropical cyclone events. A composite tropical cyclone chronology from Turkey Creek identified 58% (7 of 12) of the storms known to have produced rainfall at the site. The Big Sandy Creek composite chronology identified 65% (8 of 12) known storms. Wetter than average years that followed dry years were found to mimic the oxygen isotopic signal associated with tropical cyclone events. Additionally, dry years masked the tropical cyclone signal so that it could not be recorded in tree rings.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Signposts on the Path to Learning: A Phenomenological Case Study</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Roberts, Melba L.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to describe the phenomenon of learning among high school educators engaged in an on-line learning community studying the application of reader response theory across the curriculum following a two-day professional development (PD) workshop. The theoretical framework both for the design and content of the workshop and for the design of the study was social constructivism. The specific research question to be answered with respect to the participant, Ariel, was, &quot;what is the teacher's experience in an on-line learning community?&quot; For this phenomenological case study, the methods for data collection included two semi-structured interviews and a series of on-line communications with the teacher. Interview and email transcripts were parsed into meaning units, followed by theme analysis uncovered by a &quot;detailed reading approach&quot; (van Manen, 1990, p. 3). Three themes were threaded together to provide an impression of the teacher's experience, lending itself to description. Following a hermeneutic process, I used these themes to weave an image of the teacher's experience, and then consulted my own experiences, research and theoretical literature, and a work of young-adult literature as sources for interpretation (van Manen, 1990). I worked to ensure trustworthiness through bracketing, prolonged engagement, triangulation of multiple data sources, member checking, peer debriefing, and thick description to support transferability.
Analysis of Ariel's experience led to a description of her as a teacher committed to professional growth, influenced by her analysis of opportunity, motivation to learn, and her response to conditions that supported her growth: time for talk, time for practice, freedom of choice, and appropriate challenge. Reflection on her experience in light of my experiences and the literature on adult learning and development led to two conclusions. First, there are critical actions that foster teacher development and learning. And second, individuals who influence continuing education for teachers have a responsibility to act through an ethic of care. Implications of this research for designers of PD are that they need to keep in mind that teachers have specific needs that must be met by their learning environment, including flexibility, activities designed for adult learning and development, sustained engagement, support for collaborative learning, and obvious benefit to students. Recommendations for research growing out of the present study include exploring the relationships among student learning and teacher participation in professional development of this type, further investigations in the possibilities of online learning communities, including teachers as co-researchers in such projects, and in-depth discourse analysis of the transcripts and online communications to explore issues of power and hegemony.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Comparison of the Wellness  Levels of Victims of Domestic Violence with a Local Female Population</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Harvey, Tara Zeruie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This research project is an investigation into the wellness levels of victims of domestic violence. Wellness was measured using the Five Factor Wellness Assessment by Meyers and Sweeney (2005). The research is grounded in a theoretical trifecta comprised of the works of Alfred Adler, Hiram Maslow and the global concept of wellness as defined by Jane Meyers and Thomas Sweeney.  An exploratory factor analysis was run on the Five Factor Wellness Assessment to assess the goodness of fit for the population being studied. Wellness levels were assessed upon intake into a domestic violence shelter and compared with the national normative wellness scores using a series of one way two-tailed T-tests. Additionally, the national normative wellness scores were compared with the wellness scores of a local population using the same analysis method. The wellness scores of the victims of domestic violence were compared with the local population using a MANOVA.
Statistical significance levels were established at .003 using a Bonferroni adjustment to accommodate the number of variables that comprise the assessment. Results indicated that there are statistically significant differences between the victims of domestic violence and the national normative population in a negative direction. There are also statistically significant differences between the scores of the local population and the national normative population in a positive direction. Finally, the wellness scores of the victims of domestic violence when compared with the local population are also statistically significantly different with the victims scores being much lower than the scores of the local population. These findings create a wealth of information for practitioners and researchers in the domestic violence field and a plethora of new avenues for research.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Molecular mechanism of caffeine-induced expression of two cytochrome P450 genes, &lt;em&gt;Cyp6a2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cyp6a8&lt;/em&gt;, in &lt;em&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/em&gt;</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bhaskara, Srividya</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases or CYPs comprise a large family of enzymes that are found in all classes of living organisms, from bacteria to man. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of many endogenous and xenobiotic (foreign) compounds. In insects, CYPs confer resistance to various insecticides, and resistance-associated overexpression of multiple CYP genes in resistant insects is a common phenomenon. In Drosophila, multiple Cyp genes including Cyp6a2 and Cyp6a8 show higher level of expression in resistant strains than in the susceptible ones. To date, molecular basis of CYP gene overexpression has not been examined in detail. Barbiturate compounds such as phenobarbital and barbital induce both these genes.  An unpublished observation from our laboratory showed that Cyp6a2 as well as Cyp6a8 are induced by over-the-counter caffeine tablet, Vivarin. In the present study, I used pure caffeine as a tool to better understand the mechanism of Cyp6a2 and Cyp6a8 gene regulation in Drosophila.
The specific objectives of this project has been to (1) map the upstream DNA of both genes for the sequences responsible for caffeine-induction; (2) examine whether adenosine receptors and/or cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (cPDE) are involved in transduction of caffeine signal to induce the two Cyp6 genes; and (3) investigate whether Drosophila AP-l transcription factors (D-JUN and D-FOS) playa role in caffeine induction of Cyp6a8 gene. For these objectives, several Cyp-luc reporter plasmids carrying firefly lueiferase (luc)  reporter gene under the control of different regions of Cyp6a8 and Cyp6a2 upstream DNAs were constructed to transfect Drosophila embryonic cells, Schneider line 2 (SL-2). Two transgenic reporter strains carrying firefly lueiferase (luc) reporter gene under the control of O.8-kb or 0.2-kb upstream DNA of Cyp6a8 gene were also used to study the mechanism of caffeine induction in vivo.
Results of Northern blot analysis showed that caffeine induces endogenous Cyp6a2 and Cyp6a8 genes at the steady-state mRNA levels both in reporter transgenic and wild-type flies. Transfection experiments with SL-2 cells showed that -983/-1 and 7611-11 upstream DNAs of Cyp6a2 and Cyp6a8, respectively, have sequences for caffeine-induced expression. Further transfection experiments with reporter plasmids carrying luc reporter gene attached to truncated upstream DNAs of Cyp6a2 and Cyp6a8 genes showed that the regions between -265/-129 of Cyp6a2 and -199/-109 of Cyp6a8 have sequences that confer caffeine-induced expression. However, the level of both constitutive and induced expression was highest with -981/-1 DNA of Cyp6a2and -761111 DNA of Cyp6a8genes. Sequence analysis identified several putative binding sites for Activator Protein -1 (AP-l) and cyclic AMP response element CRE binding protein. (CREB) motifs in the upstream DNA of both genes. Moreover, when the four core bases of the single AP-l site present in the -109/-11 DNA of Cyp6a8 were mutated, constitutive expression decreased by 8-fold, suggesting the positive role of AP-l in Cyp6a8 gene expression.
To examine whether caffeine signaling is mediated via adenosine receptor (AdoR) and/or via cPDE inhibition, SL-2 cells transfected with Cyp6a2 and Cyp6a8 reporter constructs were treated with AdoR agonists or with antagonists or with cPDE inhibitors. The  Cyp6a8-luc reporter transgenic lines were also treated with these chemicals. The results showed that caffeine signaling is mediated by PDE inhibition and via increase in the intracellular cAMP level. Indeed, treatment with dibutyryl cAMP induces Cyp6a2 as well as Cyp6a8 promoters. Since induction of cAMP pathway is known to upregulate AP-I transcription factors, effect of overexpression of Drosophila D-FOS and (or) DJUN (components of AP-I) on Cyp6a8 promoter activity in SL-2 cells was examined. Surprisingly, activity of Cyp6a8-1uc reporter construct was inhibited when D-FOS or DJUN proteins were overexpressed, suggesting that AP-I proteins are inhibitory for Cyp6 gene expression. In contrast, the Cyp6a8 promoter activity was upregulated, when cells were transfected with anti-D-JUN plasmid or when cells transfected with D-JUN or DFOS sense construct were treated with caffeine. When relation between caffeine and the two AP-I proteins was examined, it was found that caffeine treatment significantly lowers the D-JUN protein level both in SL-2 cells as well as in adult flies. Reporter gene assays and Northern blot analysis showed that caffeine treatment has no effect on the transcriptional activity of the D-jun and D-fos genes. Taken together, it might be concluded that caffeine induction of  Cyp6a2 and Cyp6a8 genes is mediated via degradation of D-JUN that acts as a repressor for the promoter of Cyp6a8.  Induction of the cAMP pathway and subsequent phosphorylation of the AP-l proteins may relieve the AP-l mediated-repression by promoting the degradation of these proteins. Further investigation is required to resolve these possibilities.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Reliability in Lean Systems</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Keyser, Robert S</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Implementation of Lean manufacturing systems often turn into expensive hit-or-miss propositions. Whereas many organizations that lack immediate success quickly abandon their ‘Lean’ plans in hopes that the next great marketing panacea will solve their efficiency woes, organizations that experience early success often have difficulty in sustaining their Lean efforts. To further exacerbate the dilemma, knowledge of the reliability of Lean systems is currently inadequate. This paper proposes a contemporary Lean paradigm – reliability in Lean systems – through the development of an innovative Lean System Reliability model (LSRM). Principally, LSRM models the reliability of Lean subsystems as a basis for determining the reliability of Lean systems as a whole. Lean subsystems, in turn, consist of reliability measures for Lean components. Once principal components analysis techniques are employed to determine critical subsystems, value stream mapping is used to illustrate the critical subsystem workflow sequence. Monte Carlo simulations are performed for the Lean system, its subsystems, and components and are then compared with historical data to determine the adequacy of the LSRM model. In addition, a regression model is developed to ascertain the contribution of LSRM towards predicting % on time delivery.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>“Successful Communication in a Social Movement: A Case Study of the Montgomery Bus Boycott</dc:title>
<dc:creator>McGhee-Hilt, Felicia</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The Montgomery Bus Boycott was a social movement. It is often referred to as the first defining movement within the broader context of the Civil Rights Movement. Planned communication can be critical to the success of a social movement. This historical case study analyzed the communication that occurred during the 1955-1956 Montgomery Bus Boycott, a 381-day protest of the segregated bus system in Montgomery. The overall research questions addressed were: How was communication used during the boycott to inform and mobilize the participants? How did news organizations mediate and frame communication? How was the information about the boycott communicated among and between the participants, churches and other networks?
Qualitative methods (interviewing, frame analysis and archival analysis) were used to address these questions. Interviews were conducted with former participants to determine how they received their information about the boycott and how they stayed informed during the course of the protest. Content analysis was conducted on Montgomery Advertiser stories published about the boycott between Dec. 1, 1955 (the day Rosa Parks was arrested) and Dec. 21,1956 (the day the first court-ordered integrated buses operated in Montgomery) to determine the frames projected by the newspaper’s coverage. Archival analysis was used to determine the role of churches and networks such as the Montgomery Improvement Association, a group formed specifically during the boycott to help spread information to participants.
This study reveals that boycott participants were skeptical of local newspaper coverage, and instead relied heavily on the Montgomery Improvement Association, area churches and other participants for their primary information regarding the boycott. This is important in the study of social movements because it shows how critical communication networks are to a movement’s success.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Multi-scale Analysis of Disturbance Dynamics in Hardwood Forest Communities on the Cumberland Plateau, U.S.A.</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hart, Justin L</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this research was to quantify forest disturbance processes and evaluate the influence of these processes on secondary hardwood forest communities on a section of the Cumberland Plateau in Tennessee. The specific objectives of this study were to: (1) reconstruct the disturbance history of a secondary hardwood forest using species composition, stand structure, tree-ring data, and soil charcoal analyses, (2) quantify canopy gap formation mechanisms, (3) document canopy gap characteristics, and (4) determine the forest response to small-scale disturbance events. This information is useful to understand the importance of localized disturbances on stand development and forest successional patterns.
With the exception of one stand-wide disturbance in the early 1980s, the disturbance regime of the forest was characterized by localized, asynchronous events that occurred at variable spatial and temporal scales. Gap-scale disturbance events became frequent after about 40 years of forest development. The presence of soil charcoal indicated that fire had occurred in the Pogue Creek Natural Area in the past, but species composition and a lack of fire-scarred trees indicated that fire had not occurred during the development of the current stand.
The majority of canopy gaps were caused by treefall (either windthrow or basal-shear) and half of all gaps were caused by the death of a Quercus individual. Gap ages ranged from 1 to 17 years with a mean of 7 years. Seasonality of death could be accurately determined for 17 gap makers and all but one of these trees died during the growing season. Strong wind associated with convective storms is the most probable disturbance agent in the forest.
The fraction of land area in expanded gaps and true canopy gaps was 15% and 6%, respectively. The amount of land area in canopy gaps was highest for younger gaps and generally decreased with increased gap age. Most expanded and true canopy gaps had elliptical shapes and the majority of gaps were oriented perpendicular to slope contours.
Significant positive relationships were documented between expanded gap size and the density of saplings, trees, and total stems. Only weak relationships existed between stem diversity and expanded gap size. Most of the canopy gaps documented were projected to close by lateral crown expansion rather than height growth of subcanopy individuals, but gaps still provided a means for understory trees to recruit to larger size classes. Over half of all trees located in true canopy gaps with intermediate crown classifications were Acer saccharum, A. rubrum, or Liriodendron tulipifera. Because the gaps documented were relatively small and close by lateral branch growth of perimeter trees, the most shade-tolerant A. saccharum has the greatest probability of becoming dominant in the canopy under the current disturbance regime. This study indicated that gap-scale disturbance processes have an influence on stand development and successional patterns of secondary hardwood forests in the absence of large-scale events.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Plastic Deformation and Annealing of Zr- and Cu- Based Bulk Metallic Glasses</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Xie, Sujing</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Plastic deformation in crystalline metals occurs by the motion and multiplication of lattice defects called dislocations, resulting in strain hardening. Metallic glasses, in contrast, lack long-range order; therefore, dislocation-mediated plasticity is not possible in these materials. Metallic glasses undergo plastic deformation through the nucleation and propagation of defects called shear bands, which cause strain softening.
This strain softening can be recovered after annealing, i.e., annealing makes the plastically strained metallic glasses harder, in sharp contrast to the annealing-induced softening typically observed in crystalline metals. During annealing, hardness initially recovers more rapidly in heavily deformed specimens than in lightly deformed ones, at a rate that varies inversely as the shear band spacing. With increasing annealing time and temperature, hardness further increases, at the same rate whether pre-strained or not. If the deformed and annealed metallic glass is plastically deformed again, reversible softening is observed. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such reversible softening in metallic glasses has been reported.
These hardness changes were correlated with shear band patterns around/underneath a Vickers indent. Shear bands produced during indentation of as-cast glass were semi-circular and radial, consistent with the maximum stress distribution beneath the indenter. In contrast, shear bands in the pre-strained glass were irregular and convoluted, and appeared to be a mixture of shear bands produced during the preceding compression and those in as-cast glass. This indicates that shear band regions are softer than the surrounding undeformed matrix and act as preferred sites for subsequent deformation during indentation, consistent with the macroscopic strain softening vi observed after plastic deformation. After annealing, shear bands tend to recover the originally semi-circular and radial shapes associated with the hardness increase.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Actuatable Membranes based on Polypyrrole-Coated Vertically Aligned Nanostructures</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Fletcher, Benjamin L.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Nanoporous membranes are an enabling technology in a wide variety of applications because of their ability to efficiently and selectively separate molecules. A great deal of effort is concentrated on developing methods of externally controlling membrane selectivity and on integrating the membranes within multi-scale systems. In this dissertation, synthetic nanoporous membranes that fit the described needs are constructed from vertically aligned nanostructures. Vertically aligned carbon nanofibers and anisotropically etched silicon posts are aligned perpendicular to the substrate and act as obstacles to material flow parallel to the surface. The distances between the outer edges of the nanostructures define the pores of the membranes. Transport through the membranes is controlled by physically selecting species as they pass between the vertically aligned nanostructures. Membrane properties such as permeability and porosity are specified by defining the spatial locations of the membrane components. Subsequent physical and chemical modification of the nanostructures enables further tuning of pore sizes and opens up new methods to controllably modulate the permeability of the membranes. In this dissertation, permeability is externally controlled by electrochemical actuation of the conductive polymer, polypyrrole. Vertically aligned membrane components are coated with the actuatable polymer. Upon electrochemical reduction, the polypyrrole coatings swell in volume, increasing the diameters of the membrane components and decreasing the pore sizes of the membranes. Modulating the physical size of the membrane pores enables size selective transport of species and gating of the nanoscale pores.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Characterization and Performance Improvement of Chitosan Films as Affected by Preparation Method, Synthetic Polymers, and Blend Ratios</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Li, Jiajie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Chitosan films prepared with addition of other polymers have been widely studied for their modified properties. In this dissertation, poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly (N-vinyl-2- pyrrolidone) (PVP) were blended with chitosan. The objectives of the study were (1) to investigate the the effects of film thickness, blend ratios, and preparation methods on the physical, and mechanical properties and functional performance of chitosan/PEO films, and (2) to compare characteristics and functional properties of chitosan/PVP and chitosan/PEO films.
The results demonstrated that regular cast chitosan/PEO films have altered properties than films produced from either polymer alone. Regardless of molecular weight, chitosan decreased the tendency to spherulitic crystallization of PEO. Production of ultra-thin chitosan and chitosan/PEO films with thickness below 80 nm was possible by spin-coating on silicon wafers. The increase of PEO content did not affect thickness of the films but the surface of corresponding films became rougher probably due to formation of PEO crystallites.
Comparing the functional properties of thick, thin and ultra-thin chitosan/PEO films, the latter showed a significantly higher chromium binding capacity compared to the regular cast films. However, ultra-thin chitosan/PEO films did not show significant antibacterial properties due to their extremely low weight. A decreased film-forming time, especially in the spin-coating method, greatly reduced extent of film crystallization.
Incorporation of PVP or PEO into chitosan films reduced the yellowish color and made films easier to puncture and tear. Although chitosan/PEO blend films showed lower water vapor permeability (WVP) values than chitosan/PVP films, blending chitosan with hydrophilic polymers was not an effective way to significantly improve the WVP. Replacing even 50% of chitosan with PVP or PEO in chitosan films did not significantly decrease the metal-binding and antibacterial properties of the films. Since synthetic polymers are less expensive than biopolymer chitosan, blending chitosan and synthetic polymers could reduce the amount of chitosan and lower the production cost with no effect on functionality of the films. Chitosan/PVP and chitosan/PEO blend films have the potential to be used in the food industry as active packaging materials to inhibit food borne pathogens and as absorbent to bind heavy metal from the environment.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Saying Yes When You Mean No: A Phenomenological Analysis of Consensual Unwanted Sexual Activity</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Litzinger, Samantha C.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of the study was to conduct a phenomenological analysis of the experience of consensual unwanted sexual activity (CUSA). College men and women (N=10) in relationships ranging from casual to committed who were enrolled at a university in the southeastern United States were interviewed about experiences of CUSA. Interviews were conducted in person with participants who were asked to answer the following research question: “Describe a time in which you did not want to participate in some sexual activity, but you decided to anyway.” Interview transcripts were analyzed using phenomenological research methods in the context of an interpretive research group, as well as by the author alone (Pollio, Henley, &amp; Thompson, 1997). Analysis of interview data rendered a unique structure of the experience of consensual unwanted sexual activity (CUSA). The structure of CUSA is characterized by themes of Focus, Expectation, and Outcome, which emerged as figural against the ground of the interpersonal relationship in which CUSA occurred. These three themes are interrelated parts of an experiential gestalt. When an individual engages in CUSA, there is a minimization of focus on the desires of the self, in favor of a focus on the desires of the other, often to the exclusion of one’s full presence in the interaction (Focus). Engaging in CUSA involves the use of social rules, gender roles, and standards for reciprocation (Expectation). An individual engages in CUSA to bring about various desired outcomes and/or to avoid undesired outcomes; however, engaging in CUSA often results in unexpected outcomes (Outcome).
Findings suggest that CUSA may be experienced differently in committed relationships than in casual ones. In satisfied committed relationships, engaging in CUSA may be harmless or even adaptive, akin to other sacrifices made for the good of a relationship. In casual relationships, however, engaging in CUSA may result in negative outcomes such as regret and resentment. This study demonstrates the importance of context (the interpersonal relationship) to the experience of CUSA. Results suggest that the experience of CUSA might be gendered-- experienced similarly by men and women yet informed in complementary ways by rules dictating masculinity and femininity.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An Investigation of the Relationship Between Academic and Athletic Satisfaction Among Division IA Student-Athletes</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Phillips, James Joseph</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between academic and athletic satisfaction for Division IA intercollegiate athletes. Student-athletes (n = 367; 16 teams) at a Division IA university in the Midwest completed the Athlete Satisfaction Questionnaire (ASQ) and the Student Satisfaction Inventory (SSI), in addition to a demographic survey. The data was analyzed using a variety of analytical procedures including descriptive statistics, bivariate correlation, and hierarchical regression in order to answer the research questions guiding this study: 1. What is the relationship between Division IA intercollegiate athletes’ satisfaction with their academic and athletic experiences? 2. What is the relationship between Division IA intercollegiate athletes’ satisfaction with their academic and athletic satisfaction controlling for differences by: ethnicity of athlete, gender of athlete, gender of coach, leadership style of coach, nature of sport (individual vs. team-oriented), team win/loss record, year in school, grade point average, injury incurred, and extent of games missed? 3. What is the difference between the satisfaction and importance scores Division IA athletes assign to questions about their academic and athletic experiences?
There was a statistically significant relationship between academic and athletic satisfaction (p &lt; .01), even after controlling for the intervening variables. This finding suggests that academic satisfaction is a powerful predictor of athletic satisfaction.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Bullying, Victimization, Associated Distress &amp; Transition Among Intellectually Gifted Children</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Pelchar, Taylor Kaine</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This cross-sectional study examined the prevalence of bullying and victimization among children identified as gifted who are in the last grade of elementary school (4th grade) and first two grades of middle school (5th and 6th grades). Additionally, I investigated if the children experienced distress associated with bullying and victimization and if the distress varied systematically across the three grades. The study took place at one elementary school and two middle schools located in Tennessee. There were a total of 35 participants [4th grade (n = 15), 5th grade (n = 13), and 6th grade (n =7)]. The results indicated that the 4th graders reported a significantly higher prevalence of bullying compared to the 5th graders. Furthermore there were significant, strong correlations between victimization and level of total distress; bullying and level of externalizing distress; and victimization and level of internalizing distress. The principal limitation of the study was the small sample size (N = 35). Additional studies investigating this topic should be conducted to help educators become more aware of the prevalence of bullying and victimization during the elementary-middle school transition period among children who are gifted. Such studies can also potentially shed light on the manner in which children who are gifted handle bullying and victimization.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Discrete Geometric Homotopy Theory and Critical Values of Metric Spaces</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wilkins, Leonard Duane</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Building on the work of Conrad Plaut and Valera Berestovskii regarding uniform spaces and the covering spectrum of Christina Sormani and Guofang Wei developed for geodesic spaces, the author defines and develops discrete homotopy theory for metric spaces, which can be thought of as a discrete analog of classical path-homotopy and covering space theory.  Given a metric space, X, this leads to the construction of a collection of covering spaces of X - and corresponding covering groups - parameterized by the positive real numbers, which we call the [epsilon]-covers and the [epsilon]-groups.  These covers and groups evolve dynamically as the parameter decreases, changing topological type at specific parameter values which depend on the topology and local geometry of X.  This leads to the definition of a critical spectrum for metric spaces, which is the set of all values at which the topological type of the covers change.  Several results are proved regarding the critical spectrum and its connections to topology and local geometry, particularly in the context of geodesic spaces, refinable spaces, and Gromov-Hausdorff limits of compact metric spaces.  We investigate the relationship between the critical spectrum and covering spectrum in the case when X is geodesic, connections between the geometry of the [epsilon]-groups and the metric and topological structure of the [epsilon]-covers, as well as the behavior of the [epsilon]-covers and critical values under Gromov-Hausdorff convergence.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>How Mexican-American Women Define Health: Cultural Beliefs and Practices in a Non-native Environment</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wright, Emma Kathleen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Culture impacts the ways people evaluate and respond to health and illness. As a result, Mexican-American culture plays a part in how women take care of their heath and react toward the threat of breast cancer. Using previously identified dominant cultural factors that may influence the health of Mexican-American women as a foundation, this qualitative study describes how Mexican-American women define and maintain health, particularly breast health.
Hispanics are the fastest growing minority group in the United States. As a result, it is important to better understand how Mexican-American women define health and take care of themselves. Doing so will not only provide richer insights into the health behaviors of women but provide insights into family health behaviors. This study is important because it adds to the current body of knowledge by investigating the cultural beliefs of Mexican-American women, a sub-group within the larger Hispanic ethnic category. While several researchers have studied the cultural beliefs of Hispanics, it is imperative that scholars begin to further investigate the cultural beliefs of the sub-groups within the larger Hispanic ethnic category. In addition, previous studies have primarily been conducted in states that border Mexico, thus providing an opportunity for this study to contribute to the current body of literature by giving a voice to Mexican-American women in the southeast.
Using a grounded theory approach, ten in-depth interviews were conducted with Mexican-American women in the southeast. The main theme that emerged from the data was: The Maintenance of Health through Traditional Practices in a Non-native Environment.

			<dc:title>Investigation of Propagation Characteristics of Twisted Hollow Waveguides for Particle Accelerator Applications</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wilson, Joshua Lee</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A new class of accelerating structures employing a uniformly twisted waveguide is investigated. Twisted waveguides of various cross-sectional geometries are considered and analyzed. It is shown that such a twisted waveguide can support waves that travel at a speed slower than the speed of light c. The slow-wave properties of twisted structures are of interest because these slow-wave electromagnetic fields can be used in applications such as electron traveling wave tubes and linear particle accelerators.
Since there is no exact closed form solution for the electromagnetic fields within a twisted waveguide or cavity, several previously proposed approximate methods are examined, and more efficient approaches are developed. It is found that the existing perturbation theory methods yield adequate results for slowly twisted structures; however, our efforts here are geared toward analyzing rapidly twisted structures using modified finite difference methods specially suited for twisted structures.
Although the method can handle general twisted structures, three particular cross sections are selected as representative cases for careful analysis. First, a slowly twisted rectangular cavity is analyzed as a reference case. This is because its shape is simple and perturbation theory already gives a good approximate solution for such slow twists rates. Secondly, a symmetrically notched circular cross section is investigated, since its longitudinal cross section is comparable to the well known disk-loaded cavity (used in many practical accelerator designs, including SLAC). Finally, a &quot;dumbbell&quot; shaped cross section is analyzed because of its similarity to the well-known TESLA-type accelerating cavity, which is of great importance because of its wide acceptance as a superconducting cavity.
To validate the results of the developed theory and our extensive simulations, the newly developed numerical models are compared to commercial codes. Also, several prototypes are developed employing the three basic shapes discussed previously. Bench measurements are performed on the prototype cavities to evaluate dispersion by measuring the field distribution along these cavities. The measurement results are compared to the simulations and theoretical results, and good agreement is shown. Once validated, the developed models are used to design twisted accelerating structures with specific phase velocities and good accelerating performance.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Physical Properties of Unconventional Superconductors</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kuznetsova, Valentina Anatolyevna</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In the following development, we attempt to obtain basic physical properties of majority of unconventional superconductors through a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-type weak-coupling approach. The method we adopted in our study is model-independent. The weak-coupling approach depends only on the symmetry of the coupling, not on its origin. It is known that a general analysis of physical properties of unconventional superconductors is possible, but has not been done yet. The goal of our work is to develop and test such analysis, using available experimental data.
Since paramagnetic limiting for spin-singlet superconductors can be suppressed in superconductors with broken inversion symmetry of crystal lattice, a possibility for triplet-pairing opens up. However, it contradicts a P.W. Anderson theorem that spin-triplet is unlikely to occur in a material without an inversion center. Nevertheless, experimental evidence (in CePt3Si, for example) strongly supports the p-wave pairing mechanism in A12 (non-centrosymmetric) compounds. In our research, we found Re3W to be the most attractive material from the A12 family for experimental investigation and decided to concentrate on it. Although theoretically favorable in many aspects for some degree of p-wave superconductivity, annealed bulk Re3W exhibited no evidence for triplet pairing upon experimental study. Instead, we discovered behaviors usually attributed to BCS-like s-wave pairing in SC state, such as ΔCel / Cel ≈BCS value, exponential T-dependence of the specific heat and dirty-limit BCS-like normalized superfluid density,λ2 (0) / λ2 (T), at low temperatures. We report remarkably large (up to 60% of the upper critical magnetic field Hc2) reversible and linear in field magnetization, M(H), in Re3W. Subsequent magnetic measurements with application of modified flux line lattice relaxation method allowed us to construct/determine a reliable SC state phase diagram in this mildly hysteretic material, that includes data for the lower critical field Hc1(T), penetration field Hp(T), and thermodynamic critical field Hc(T). The developed technique is fast, reliable and requires virtually no processing time.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>When the Disability Is Not the Problem - Experiencing the Barriers to Web Accessibility: The Experiences of Computer Users with Visual Disabilities Using the Internet</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Spiegel, Harriette L.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this study is to describe the experiences and perceptions of three computer users with visual disabilities as they accessed and reviewed Web pages on the Internet. Attention is focused on the use of the Internet by individuals with visual disabilities: blindness, low vision, and deaf/blindness.
Data were gathered through interviews and observation, during eight sessions with each participant. Data were qualitatively analyzed using an inductive process (Hatch, 2002). Data analysis revealed six categories of meaning: interactions with computer; personal characteristics, strategies to find solutions to barriers encountered; personal feeling and opinions; design features, and communication.
Sites viewed included commercial, educational, non-profit, and governmental sites. Interviews consisted of structured and unstructured questions.
The knowledge gained in this study will add to the literature of Web Accessibility and will contribute to raising awareness of the barriers that computer users with visual disabilities encounter when using the Internet.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Evaluation of Experimental Bridges in Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Chapman, David P.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This dissertation presents an overview and evaluation of an effort of the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) to design multispan steel girder bridges that can be erected with minimal disruption to traffic passing under the proposed spans. TDOT has developed the Pier-Plate Moment Connection in order to facilitate the accelerated construction of steel girder bridges. This connection allows the girders of a multispan steel bridge to be erected as simple spans and then to be made continuous prior to the dead load of the deck being applied. Since 2003, the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Tennessee has instrumented and tested two bridges with Pier- Plate connections. The bridges were instrumented with strain gages and monitored under a variety of loading conditions.
The primary conclusions drawn from the above described research are (1) that the code specified methods for determining girder distribution factors produce conservative values, (2) that the structural contribution of concrete parapets is to stiffen the outside girders and thereby draw more load to them, and (3) that the behavior of the Pier-Plate Connection is consistent with the intent of its design.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Open Heavy Flavor Measurement at Forward Angles for Cu+Cu Collisions at Center of Mass NN Collision Energy 200 GeV</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Garishvili, Irakli</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The main purpose of Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) program is to study the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), a deconfined state of matter believed to be created in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. Heavy quarks, expected to be produced during the earlier stages of heavy ion collisions, serve as an important probe of the QGP.‎
‎The following dissertation presents measurements of single muons resulting from the semileptonic decay of heavy flavor quarks in the rapidity range of $1.4 &lt; \vert\eta\vert &lt; 1.9$ for Cu+Cu nuclei collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV measured by the PHENIX experiment. Single muon spectra were measured for three different centrality classes (0 - 20 \% , 20 - 40 \%, 40 - 94 \%) within the $p_{T}$ range of 1.0 - 4.0 GeV/c.‎
‎To calculate single muon spectra, a full background estimate was statistically subtracted from inclusive spectra of muon candidate tracks reconstructed in the PHENIX muon arms. The background was predicted and estimated with a ``Hadron Cocktail&quot;, a full-scale data-driven Monte Carlo simulation. The hadron cocktail approach was originally developed and implemented to measure single muon production for Run-5 p+p collisions. First, the relevant light hadrons are generated with a ``realistic'' input (ratios of different particle species and $p_{T}$ spectra). The generated tracks are then propagated through the PHENIX detector geometry using GEANT. At the last step, introduced and implemented specifically for this analysis, the simulated tracks were embedded into real events and finally reconstructed with the PHENIX muon arms reconstruction software. This was done to realistically reproduce detector performance due to effects caused by colliding heavy ions. The hadron cocktail method provides a much better alternative to the previously attempted purely data-driven peacemeal approaches which suffer from very large systematic uncertainties.‎ ‎Finally, using baseline single muon measurements for p+p collisions, nuclear modification factors for all of the above specified centralities have been measured. These are the first measurements of single muon spectra and nuclear modification factors at forward angles for any two heavy colliding ion systems.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Characterization and modeling of toxic fly ash constituents in the environment</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Zhu, Zhenwei</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Coal fly ash is a by-product of coal combustion that has drawn renewed public scrutiny due to the negative environmental impacts from accidental release of this waste material from storage facilities. Historically, the leaching of toxic elements from coal fly ash into the environment has always been a major environmental concern. Despite extensive efforts into the characterization of coal fly ash, effective models for the fate and transport of toxic fly ash constituents have remained lacking, making it difficult to perform accurate environmental impact assessment for coal fly ash. To close this critical knowledge gap, the overall objective of this study was to develop a predictive model for the leaching of toxic elements from fly ash particles. First, physical properties of coal fly ash were characterized to evaluate their contribution to elemental transport. Unburned carbon was shown to contribute to the sorption of arsenic to fly ash, which slowed the release of arsenic from fly ash. In parallel, leaching properties of various elements were determined to differentiate species of varying leaching capacities, demonstrating that the majority of toxic elements were not mobile under environmentally relevant conditions. Subsequently, a mechanistic model for the dissolution of fly ash elements was developed and validated with batch kinetics studies. Furthermore, elemental dissolution was integrated with hydrodynamic modeling to describe the leaching of toxic elements from fly ash in dry disposal facilities, which was validated by column studies. The mechanistic model developed and validated in this research represents the first such model that successfully characterized the complex processes underlying the release and transport of toxic elements in coal fly ash, providing a valuable tool to predict the environment impact of coal fly ash and develop more effective management practices for both the industry and regulators.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Phenomenological Investigation of Creativity in Person Centered Expressive Therapy</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Khanna, Mukti</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The field of creative or expressive arts therapies seeks to harness the power for'creative expression to the process of psychotherapy. Although expressive arts therapies are increasingly being used with a variety of populations, including the elderly, the disabled, intergenerational, and cross-cultural groups, a comprehensive theory of expressive arts therapies has yet to emerge. In addition, there is a paucity of research of what works in such therapies. A comprehensive theory of expressive arts therapies, however, can only emerge from the expressive arts themselves, reflecting the uniqueness of the creative process that is at their foundation. Qualitative research focusing on the experience of creativity in expressive therapy settings may be an essential step toward the development of a theory of expressive therapies.
Using phenomenological research methods, this study explores the experience of creativity in relation to training programs conducted at the Person Centered Expressive Therapy Institute (PCETI). Coparticipants were eighteen adults, ages 27 through 65, involved in the institute from a variety of national and international locations. A dialogical research interview was chosen to study the experience of creativity in the context of PCETI. Written transcripts were made from the audiotapes of interviews and used to develop themes that described coparticipants' experiences of feeling creative. A structure of the experience of creativity in relation to PCETI emerged consisting of seven themes: experiencing the creative connection, universality, sharing, trusting, allowing, freeing, and empowering. Methodological checks were incorporated into the data analysis to ensure rigor. The use of a scoring manual and fidelity checks of the themes to coparticipants' experience and the researcher's colleagues' understanding of the phenomenon are described in the context of a qualitative research paradigm.
Results are discussed in relation to PCETI, the person centered approach, expressive therapies, and transpersonal paradigms. The results of this study have implications for the development of a theory of expressive arts therapies and for expanding applications of the person-centered approach. Results also suggest phenomenology provides a rigorous, yet compatible, methodology to research expanding applications of the person-centered approach as well as other realms of humanistic psychology.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Factorial Validity of the National Survey of Student Engagement</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Esquivel, Shelley Leigh</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this research was to explore the factorial validity of the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE), a survey widely used by institutions of higher education. Specifically, using data collected from first-year students and seniors at The University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UT), this research addressed three research questions. First, to what extent does the five-factor model of NSSE (i.e., the benchmark model) exhibit factorial validity? Second, to what extent is Pike’s (2006b) scalelet model of the NSSE factorially valid? Finally, is there a model that depicts the NSSE data better than the models consisting of benchmarks or scalelets? The participants of this study were first-year (n = 981) and senior (n = 944) students at UT who completed the online version of the NSSE in the spring of 2009. Using confirmatory factor analysis, results suggested poor model fit for both the benchmark model and Pike’s (2006b) scalelet model. Exploratory factor analysis with oblique rotation (Promax) resulted in a six-factor solution consisting of 27 items that accounted for approximately 39 percent of variance. The six-factor model failed, however, to exhibit sufficient model fit when confirmatory factor analysis was applied to a different data set (i.e., NSSE data collected in the spring of 2010). Overall, results suggest that much more validation research is needed for the National Survey of Student Engagement to ensure that its use among institutions of higher education is appropriate.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Sublethal Toxicity of Microcystis and Microcystin-LR in Fish</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Rogers, Emily Dawn</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The occurrence of blooms of toxic cyanobacteria in freshwater environments is a global ecological and public health concern.  Species of Microcystis are of particular importance because blooms occur in many freshwater environments throughout the world and microcystin toxin concentrations can exceed World Health Organization advisory levels.  While microcystin has been associated with fish kills, sublethal effects of chronic exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations are relatively unknown.  The objective of this research was to evaluate toxicity of microcystin and Microcystis in fish during all life history stages.  We evaluated global gene expression response in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio), and a sub-set of biomarker genes indicative of microcystin exposure were identified.  In addition, vitellogenin genes were highly up-regulated in zebrafish exposed to Microcystis but not the microcystin toxin, indicating potential endocrine disrupting effects of Microcystis blooms.  Effects on reproduction were evaluated in adult zebrafish exposed to Microcystis.  There was a significant decrease in the percentage of adults that spawned, however fecundity and larval survival were not affected.  Laboratory mesocosm experiments with channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) were also conducted to determine the importance of dietary and aqueous exposure in microcystin bioaccumulation and assess histopathological lesions.  Tissue toxin concentrations and histopathological lesions were also evaluated in channel catfish collected from Lake Erie and Waterville Reservoir, North Carolina to monitor fish living in environments affected by Microcystis blooms and relate responses to those observed in laboratory exposures.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Characterization of a Biomimetic Calcium-Deficient Hydroxyapatite-Bacterial Cellulose Composite</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hutchens, Stacy</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Bone is the second most implanted tissue next to blood causing approximately 2.2 million people to receive bone grafts each year. Developing safe synthetic bone grafts allows quick and safe restoration of bone function while avoiding the surgical risks associated with bone autografting (self donation), and risks of disease transmission and immunogenic response associated with allografts (bone donated from other humans) and xenografts (grafts derived from animal tissue). This dissertation entails the study and development of a novel potential synthetic bone graft consisting of a composite of calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite (CdHAP) biomimetically deposited in a bacterial cellulose (BC) hydrogel.
To determine which conditions provided optimum cellulose growth from Gluconacetobacter hansenii (ATCC 10821), a statistical analysis of the effects of different culture parameters was carried out. This utilized fractional factorial design which allowed a large number of factors to be tested using an abbreviated set of experiments. Statistical software was also used to process the data to determine which factors and factor interactions were significant to bacterial cellulose production.
Purified bacterial cellulose was mineralized by sequential incubations in solutions of calcium chloride followed by sodium phosphate dibasic. This material was characterized using X-Ray Diffractometry, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Electron Dispersive Spectroscopy, and mechanical testing. Characterization revealed that the CdHAP formed biomimetically in the BC in a manner similar to natural bone. It was also determined that the CdHAP had comparable structure, size, and composition to that found in natural bone.
An ideal bone replacement material will degrade after stimulating new osseous tissue production. A chemical modification of the cellulose was carried out with periodate oxidation to render it degradable in-vivo. The BC structure was preserved as well as its ability to mineralize CdHAP after periodate oxidation. This composite was characterized and its capacity to degrade was analyzed by subjecting the samples to a simulated aqueous physiological environment.
The last chapter discusses how the BC-CdHAP composite may have clinical use in the major bone grafting procedures currently being administered. Several surgeons were surveyed for this portion of the study to determine which grafts they used, the reasons for graft selection, and to obtain their opinion of the BC-CdHAP material. It was ultimately determined that the BC-CdHAP composite has ideal properties for dental bone grafting procedures including site extraction preservation and sinus lifts.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Using Transformative Learning Theory to Investigate Ways to Enrich University Teaching: Focus on the Implementation of Student-Centered Teaching in Large Introductory Science Courses</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Badara, Ioana Alexandra</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Previous studies have reported high attrition rates in large-enrollment science courses where teacher-centered instruction was prevalent. The scientific literature provides strong evidence that student-centered teaching, which involves extensive active learning, leads to deepened learning as the result of effective student engagement. Consequently, professional development initiatives have continually focused on assisting academics with the implementation of active learning. Generally, higher education institutions engage faculty in professional development through in-service workshops that facilitate learning new teaching techniques in a specific context. These workshops usually do not include self-scrutiny concerning teaching or do they provide continuous support for the implementation of strategies learned in the workshop.
The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of a professional development program that consisted of a workshop focused on the implementation of active learning in large science courses and extended to include post-workshop activities, on participants’ enactment of teaching practices introduced in the workshop. More specifically, through a qualitative methodology and employing transformative learning theory, this work evaluated the influence of science instructors’ engagement in dialogue and critical self-reflection on their teaching approaches and practices. Engagement in critical reflection was facilitated through watching of teaching videotapes followed by participants’ engagement in dialogue about teaching with the researcher. Findings suggest that providing continuous post-workshop support by fostering engagement in critical self-reflection and dialogue, can lead to transformative learning about teaching. More specifically, participation in the program led to the transformation of teaching practices, while teaching approaches remained unchanged. While some obstacles to the transformation of teaching approaches were identified, major outcomes indicate that meaningful professional development can go far beyond learning how to use new teaching strategies through faculty engagement in critical reflection and dialogue on teaching.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Experiencing Sexually Objectifying Environments: A Case Study</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Moffitt, Lauren Bell</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Research examining tenets of Objectification Theory (Fredrickson &amp; Roberts, 1997) has given little attention to increasing our understanding of specific environments and subcultures, such as beauty pageants, cheerleading, and cocktail waitressing that exist within our culture where sexual objectification of women is encouraged, promoted, and socially sanctioned. This qualitative case study of women’s experiences in a sexually objectifying environment includes interviews with 11 women as well as observational data. Data classification via the constant comparative method resulted in nine themes: reasons for involvement, ambivalence, counterfeit intimacy, sexual objectification, resistance strategies, power, negative relationships with women, changes over time, and judgment. Corresponding subthemes are also described and interpretation is provided in light of relevant literature. Women’s experiences in a sexually objectifying environment are further discussed in terms of the need for resources and power and the resulting conflicts that women experience in terms of relational dynamics and personal safety.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Magnetic Field Effects on Photocurrent and Photovoltaic Processes in Organic Solar Cells</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Xu, Zhihua</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Two mechanisms were investigated to understand the magnetic field effects on photocurrent (MFP), a phenomenon whereby an external magnetic field (MF) can increase or decrease photocurrent in organic solar cells (OSCs). The first one relates to MF-modulated intersystem crossing (ISC) between singlet and triplet polaron pairs and charge transfer (CT) complexes, accounting for the positive MFP in low and high magnetic field, respectively. The second mechanism originates from the interaction between triplet excited states and charge carriers, namely triplet-charge reaction (TCR). External magnetic field was found to reduce the rate constant of TCR, leading to negative MFP.
MFP measurements were used to study the dissociation processes of singlet and triplet excitons in single-layer solar cells. It was found that the triplet excitons mainly dissociate directly into free charge carriers at the metal-electrode interface due to their long diffusion length, while the singlet excitons experience significant bulk dissociation into polaron pairs due to their short diffusion length. The interfacial dissociation of triplet excitons at the metal electrode can lead to enhanced photovoltaic (PV) response from phosphorescent materials as compared to the bulk dissociation of singlet excitons in fluorescent materials.
measurements were also applied to study the charge carrier generation and recombination processes in bulk-heterojunction solar cells. It was found that dissociation of polaron pairs, triplet-charge reaction, dissociation of hot excitons, and photoinduced charge transfer are responsible for charge carrier generation in OSCs. High-field MFP reflects the recombination of dissociated electrons and holes towards the formation of singlet and triplet CT complexes in bulk-heterojunction OSCs. The annealing effect on the formation of CT complexes was also investigated.
The PV efficiency of bulk-heterojunction solar cells was improved by uniformly dispersing phosphorescent heavy-metal complexes. The MFP results suggest that the spin-orbit coupling and the density of triplet excited states in conjugated polymer MEH-PPV were enhanced by external heavy-atom effect. The increased triplet density facilitated exciton dissociation and reduced charge recombination, and consequently improved the PV response in bulk-heterojunction cells.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Invisible Mink</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Janeshek, Jessie L</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Emily Dickinson, Frances Sargent Osgood, and Sarah Piatt render the nineteenth-century “women’s sphere” ironically Unheimliche while simultaneously conveying it as the “home sweet home” the sentimental tradition prescribes it should be. These American women poets turn the domestic milieu into, as Paula Bennett phrases it, “the gothic mise en scene par excellence…the displacements, doublings, and anxieties characterizing gothic experience are the direct consequence of domestic ideology’s impact on the lives and psyches of ordinary bourgeois women (121-122).”
Anne Sexton and Sylvia Plath continue to represent the Unheimliche home in their poetry through the middle of the twentieth century, specifically by portraying the woman writer’s homebound experience as a fearful one; the materials of writing surrounding Plath’s and Sexton’s speakers encourage both creation and self-destruction. The speakers of Invisible Mink confront writing similarly in that the process of making a poem is couched in extreme anxiety. Poetic creation in my collection is explored via gothic conventions including the use of doubles, or poetic doppelgangers, as multiple speakers in poems.
Recent poetry and criticism by Lyn Hejinian, Brenda Hillman, Mary Ruefle, and Olena Kalytiak Davis navigate the space between “home” and “away” in terms of tensions between the “feminine” and the “masculine” and the “confessional” and the “experimental.” Innovations in form and content throughout Invisible Mink are encouraged by Hillman’s work with blank space on the page and Hejinian’s writings on the materiality of words and forms. The use of classic film as a guiding motif in Invisible Mink is particularly inspired by Ruefle’s erasures and Davis’ “samplings,” as termed by critic Ira Sadoff, of classical literary texts.
Invisible Mink serves as an example of one woman artist’s “survival story” and is also, I hope, a testament to other women artists’ similar ordeals.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An Historical Analysis of Thinking in Resources Published by the National Council for the Social Studies (NCSS): 1977 – 2006</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Karabulut, Ulku Serezli</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to examine the various descriptions and perspectives concerning thinking in the social studies literature as expressed by social studies scholars in NCSS journals and publications across a thirty – year time frame, 1977 to 2006. A corollary purpose was to describe the various perspectives regarding methods of teaching thinking that prevailed in published NCSS resources on social studies education. The journals examined for this dissertation were Social Education, Social Studies and the Young Learner, and Middle Level Learning.
A total of two hundred twenty three (223) articles from the thirty-year period dealt with thinking in some way or another. One hundred thirty two (132) of them were used for the final analysis. Based on the previous literature reviews, the researcher identified words thinking, critical thinking, decision making, and problem solving as search keywords. The researcher examined each article critically and thoroughly, looked for the answers to the research questions she was pursuing and looked for meaningful patterns with regard to the definition of thinking.
The researcher concluded, based on her analysis that: 1- There is a problematic, persistent absence of a clear definition for thinking in the literature. However, social studies scholars preferred the term critical thinking by and large and conceptualized it as a combination of lower level and higher level skills, specifically analysis, evaluation, judgment, questioning and inquiring as well as certain dispositions and attitudes. 2- Scholars equated critical thinking with decision making and problem solving and related that to levels of understanding citizenship. 3- The ways scholars conceptualized thinking are related to their preferences regarding methods of teaching thinking, 4- There was a strong correspondence between the characteristics of thinking emphasized by NCSS and those focused on by scholars.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Hawks versus Doves: The Influence of Political Ideology on the Foreign Policy Behavior of Democratic States</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Calin, Costel</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This dissertation examines the influence of executive ideological orientation on state foreign policy behavior. I advance an analytical model which asserts that foreign policy decisionmakers act in a manner consistent with the ideological principles presented in their political platforms, party manifestos, and their voters' expectations. Thus, I assert that within developed democracies, the further right a government is, the higher the propensity to behave more aggressively. Oppositely, the further left a government is, the more likely it is to behave more cooperatively.
I empirically analyze this theoretical argument by developing three models where the foreign policy behavior is measured uniquely in each separate model. I estimate executive ideology by using two proxies: one which estimates the overall ideology of the executive while the other captures only the foreign policy dimension of executive ideology. To test the hypotheses derived from the theoretical model, I create a new dataset of responses to international crises. Foreign policy behavior is operationalized as an ordinal variable which takes into account a complex range of actions that governments take in the international arena, such as providing aid, mediation, non intervention, condemnation, sanctions, and the use of force. I employ Logit and Orderd Logit statistical analyses on a large-N cross national model. My dissertation focuses on all 22 OECD countries, during the period 1977 to 2001.
The empirical findings partially support my theoretical argument, contingent upon the proxy used for executive ideology and the way state behavior is estimated. I find consistent support to my argument if executive ideology is estimated with the proxy which contains only the party manifestos' foreign policy variables.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Users’ Help-Seeking Behaviors within the Context of Computer Task Accomplishment: An Exploratory Study</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wu, Lei</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study investigated computer users’ help-seeking behaviors within the context of accomplishing a novel and challenging computer task. In addition, this study examined how different help-seeking behavioral variables relate to both personal factors and outcome measures in an exploratory manner. Finally, a structural model examined the effect of personal factors on task performance through the mediating function of help-seeking effectiveness. A total of 67 undergraduate students participated in the study. Participants were asked to perform a challenging task in Microsoft Word. The usability software MORAE was used to record the interactions between participants and computer systems. Participants had access to five help sources: “F1 help,” “reference book,” “the Web,” “video tutorial,” and “lab assistant,” which differ in media type (electronic vs. non-electronic) and interactivity levels (high vs. low).
This study found that participants showed a wide range of help-seeking behaviors. Some participants were more active in seeking help than others. Participants also engaged in different help-seeking patterns when using different help sources. A dominant help-seeking strategy was to stay with the same source used in the previous help-seeking episode. Help-seeking behavior affected task performances, but personal factors had no significant effect on help seeking or task performances.  Based on the findings, the research value of this study, its practical implications, its limitations, and future research directions are discussed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The current study assessed the moderating effects of Age and the mediating effects of Job Satisfaction on the relationship between antecedents Employee Engagement and Compensation Fairness and the outcome variable Turnover Intent. The theory of reasoned action and a theoretical framework for examining age-effects on employee attitudes were used as the theoretical underpinnings for the study. The study utilized a secondary data set with surveyed population including faculty (n = 1,229) from a land-grant institution holding the doctoral/research-extensive classification from the Carnegie Classification and serving about 42,000 students each year with graduates totaling more than 9,000 per year. Findings confirmed that 11 of the 12 items of the Gallup Workplace Audit loaded on the Employee Engagement factor. Findings also confirmed a 3-item solution for the Compensation Fairness factor. Both Employee Engagement and Compensation Fairness demonstrated an inverse relationship with Turnover Intent as expected. Job Satisfaction was found not to mediate the relationship between both Employee Engagement and Compensation Fairness with the outcome variable Turnover Intent. Finally, Age was not found to moderate the relationship between antecedent variables and Turnover Intent. Recommendations for research and practice were made.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Climatic Adaptation and Postcranial Metric Variation in Precontact North America</dc:title>
<dc:creator>King, Kathryn A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate patterns of variation in the postcranial skeleton of prehistoric American populations as they are related to variation in climate. Two ecogeographical rules proposed by Karl Bergmann (1847) and Joel Allen (1877) describe expected patterns of variation with widespread, warm-blooded species. Modern humans in the Old World largely conform to this pattern (Holliday 1997a). This study seeks to explore if the same patterns are present in the New World.
Skeletal material from 25 North American bioarchaeological collections was used in this analysis. A series of 29 measurements of the postcranial skeleton were collected from 854 individuals. These measurements were analyzed with respect to site-specific temperature and precipitation data using univariate and multiple regression analysis, analysis of size and shape using “Mosimann” type shape variables (Darroch and Mosimann 1985), and canonical correlation analysis.
The results of this study show that there is a significant relationship between climate and postcranial variation in this sample, particularly in measurements of long bone length and epiphyseal size. Radius and tibia length appear to be the most highly correlated with climate variables, as would be expected if thermoregulation is a significant biological stress (Holliday 1999).
Comparison between this sample and data collected from Old World samples suggest that adaptation to climate has occurred in North America, but not to the same degree as is seen in the Old World. This suggests that the relatively recent peopling of the Americas, as well as other factors such possible long-distance migrations, have influenced the potential effects of adaptation to climate.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Identifying the Processes of Teacher Application and Adoption of a Novel Instructional Strategy</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Richards, Jennifer Kathryn</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Research on adolescent learning shows that students learn best when they are actively engaged with the content and when metacognitive teaching strategies are employed. Despite these findings, current studies show that most classrooms are still teacher centered and that passive learning strategies are the norm. To help teachers incorporate highly effective instructional strategies into their classrooms countless professional development workshops are offered each; yet most of these workshops fail to effect true change in the classroom behavior of teachers.
The design of this study compares teachers’ attempts to employ new instructional strategies within the context of a model curriculum with subsequent attempts to employ those same strategies outside of the model. The purposes of this study were to: (1) investigate how teachers apply new knowledge, attitudes, or behaviors and adopt them as a regular part of their instructional process; (2) identify barriers to instructional change; and (3) examine the impact of a research-based professional development model on teachers’ use of a novel instructional strategy.
The results of this study indicate that teachers need to understand the educational theory behind new strategies, see the strategy modeled for them, be provided with opportunities to discuss the strategy as it relates to their classrooms and current instructional practices, and have on-site support when implementing the strategy on their own.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Quantum Mechanical/Molecular Mechanical Molecular Dynamics Simulations on Enzymes</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Xu, Qin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The dynamic nature of proteins in solution is often an indispensable factor in biological function such as enzymatic catalysis. Complementary to the conventional structural analysis, computational simulations have the advantage to reflect the dynamic nature of proteins or enzymes. One of the computational simulation methods, the quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, has been widely applied to the research in structural analysis, ligand-receptor binding and enzymatic catalysis.
In this dissertation, QM/MM MD simulations were applied to the studies on cytidine deaminase (CDA), yeast cytosine deaminase (yCD), and kumamolisin-As, as well as two protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs), DIM-5 and SET7/9. In the simulations of the transition state analogue (TSA) binding of zebularine 3, 4-hydrate to CDA and of 4-[R]-hydroxyl-3,4-dihydropyrimidine (DHP) to yCD, proton transfers were observed between the TSA and a catalytic Glu residue in both cases. Such general acidbase mechanism was also observed in the stabilization of the tetrahedral intermediate by a critical Asp residue during the acylation of kumamolisin-As. Moreover, dynamic substrate-assisted catalysis (DSAC) involving the His of the substrate at P1 site was proposed. It was suggested that DSAC may contribute to the transition state stabilizations and substrate specificity of kumamolisin-As. The origin of the product specificities of PKMTs was studied by comparison of QM/MM MD simulations on the first, second and third methyl transfers in the trimethylase DIM5 and the monomethylase SET7/9. The product specificities of the enzymes can be well explained by population distributions of well-aligned reactive structures and the relative free energy barriers for the methyl transfers. The structural and energetic reasons for the product specificities were discussed and a triplet code based on the relative free energy barriers for the three methyl transfers was proposed in the determination of product specificities of PKMTs.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Investigation of Vorticity Confinement as a High Reynolds Number Turbulence Model</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lynn, Nicholas F.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Vorticity Confinement (VC) is a computational technique used to compute fluid flows with thin vortical regions in an accurate and efficient manner. Recent results have shown that it accurately computes the turbulent wake behind blunt bodies at large Reynolds numbers. Physically, these flows are dominated by thin vortices that convect downstream with the flow, which accounts for the important higher-order velocity statistics. These thin vortices are artificially dissipated with traditional methods, whereas VC can accurately compute them.
VC consists of a set of discrete equations with the confinement appearing as a source term in the discretized momentum equations. The term is formulated to act solely on the small vortical regions of the flow which are artificially spread with traditional methods. The role of the confinement term is to contract the vortices to counteract the artificial spreading, while maintaining the conservation of properties.
Previous VC investigations into turbulence utilized a constant user-specified confinement strength which is analogous to the Boussinesq assumption. Here, two new models for free turbulence are developed and validated along with a near-wall turbulence model. The models replace the user-specified confinement strength with a confinement strength based upon properties of the flows. The models choose the most appropriate confinement strength to conserve energy, and in this way the new models are analogous to dynamic sub-grid models of LES. These models are developed such that energy behaves in a physically consistent manner for high Reynolds number turbulence-energy decays solely at the smallest scales.
The new models for free turbulence are validated against experiment, numerical and analytical solutions for the Taylor-Green vortex and the decay of forced homogenous turbulence. Results indicate that the inertial range can extend to the largest wavenumber resolvable by the computational grid. A new near-wall model is validated for the case of flat plate boundary layer flow. A final investigation for the flow over a back-facing step is also conducted and compared against experiment. VC results are found to be comparable to other LES computations but far more economical, since a coarser grid is used.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Identification and Characterization of Phenotypically Distinct Aggregates within Huntingtin-inducible PC12 Cell Models</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Rowe, Erica LeAnn</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The role of various polyglutamine (polyGln) aggregated states in the disease mechanism of expanded CAG repeat disorders continues to be a perplexing subject. We are interested in learning more about these species and the relationship between the aggregation pathways. We have developed an innovative staining technique that allows, for the first time, the visualization of small polyGln aggregates, which we refer to as aggregation foci (AF), that are functionally distinguished by their ability to serve as seeds for amyloid growth. The aggregation foci stain should prove useful in the Huntington’s disease research as a tool for the identification of a functional class of aggregates that was previously undescribed. The ability to account for different aggregates may provide a better correlation with neurodegeneration. Using this method we were able to detect at least four phenotypic classes of aggregates in stable PC12 cells engineered for inducible expression of different polyGln repeat length forms of a green fluorescent protein-fused huntingtin (htt) exon-1 fragment: 1) small, recruitment-competent, cytoplasmic AF, 2) large, cytoplasmic, perinuclear, green-fluorescent, recruitment-inert htt aggregates, 3) cytoplasmic, perinuclear, green-fluorescent, recruitment-competent aggregates, and 4) small, nuclear, recruitment-inert, green-fluorescent aggregates. Each species can be found either in isolation or co-existing within the same microscope field depending on the time post-induction and Gln repeat-length. In our studies, AF tend to be the earliest species that appear in the cells. The PC12 cells generally did not exhibit indications of toxicity due to the polyGln species, and thus provided a good model to study the aggregation pathway without the bias of cell death. Biochemical data were gathered to understand the properties of each distinct aggregate specie. We also examined the ability of two separate compounds (curcumin and demecolcine) to alter the aggregation pathway. Each experiment was designed to obtain knowledge about possible precursor/product relationships that exist among the species, with the ultimate goal of gaining insight into the aggregation pathways responsible for the formation of the amyloid-like AF and larger inert aggregates that arise in these the cell lines expressing various polyGln repeat-lengths. We interpret this data as indicating that the two species are on competing assembly pathways.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Neutron scattering study of the high Tc superconductors</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Zhao, Jun</dc:creator>
<dc:description>We carried out systematic neutron scattering experiments to investigate the magnetic properties and their relationship to the high-$T_c$ superconductivity, when the materials are tuned from their antiferromagnetic (AF) parent compounds to the superconducting regime.
We observed resonance mode in the electron doped cuprate Nd$_{1.85}$Ce$_{0.15}$CuO$_4$, demonstrating that the resonance is a general phenomenon in cuprate superconductors regardless of hole- or electron-doping. In Pr$_{0.88}$LaCe$_{0.12}$CuO$_4$, the local susceptibility displays two distinct energy scales that are broadly consistent with the bosonic modes revealed by scanning tunneling microscopy experiments. These results indicate the presence of very strong electron spin excitations couplings in electron doped cuprates.
Shortly after the discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in the Fe pnictides, we discovered that the magnetic phase diagram of CeFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$ is remarkably similar to that of the cuprates. Besides CeFeAsO, similar magnetic and lattice structures are also observed in PrFeAsO and SrFe$_2$As$_2$ systems. Neutron scattering measurements show that in SrFe$_2$As$_2$, the spectrum of magnetic excitations consists of a Bragg peak at the elastic position, a spin gap, and sharp spin-wave excitations at higher energies. Based on the observed dispersion relation, we estimated the effective magnetic exchange coupling using a Heisenberg model.
In order to study the nature of the exchange interactions in the parent compound of Fe pnictides, we studied the high energy spin-wave excitations in CaFe$_2$As$_2$. Although the spin waves in the entire Brillouin zone can be described by an effective three-dimensional anisotropic Heisenberg Hamiltonian, the magnetism in this system is neither purely local nor purely itinerant; rather it is a complicated mix of the two.
When the Fe pnictide is tuned into superconducting regime with doping, the low energy spin fluctuation is dominated by a resonance mode. In the optimally electron doped BaFe$_{1.9}$Ni$_{0.1}$As$_2$, application of a magnetic field that suppresses the superconductivity and superconducting gap energy also reduces the intensity and energy of the resonance. These results suggest that the energy of the resonance is proportional to the electron pairing energy, and thus indicate that spin fluctuations are intimately related to the mechanism of high $T_c$ superconductivity.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Yield and Reliability Analysis for Nanoelectronics</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Yuan, Tao</dc:creator>
<dc:description>As technology has continued to advance and more break-through emerge, semiconductor devices with dimensions in nanometers have entered into all spheres of our lives. Accordingly, high reliability and high yield are very much a central concern to guarantee the advancement and utilization of nanoelectronic products. However, there appear to be some major challenges related to nanoelectronics in regard to the field of reliability: identification of the failure mechanisms, enhancement of the low yields of nano products, and management of the scarcity and secrecy of available data [34]. Therefore, this dissertation investigates four issues related to the yield and reliability of nanoelectronics.
Yield and reliability of nanoelectronics are affected by defects generated in the manufacturing processes. An automatic method using model-based clustering has been developed to detect the defect clusters and identify their patterns where the distribution of the clustered defects is modeled by a new mixture distribution of multivariate normal distributions and principal curves. The new mixture model is capable of modeling defect clusters with amorphous, curvilinear, and linear patterns. We evaluate the proposed method using both simulated and experimental data and promising results have been obtained.
Yield is one of the most important performance indexes for measuring the success of nano fabrication and manufacturing. Accurate yield estimation and prediction is essential for evaluating productivity and estimating production cost. This research studies advanced yield modeling approaches which consider the spatial variations of defects or defect counts. Results from real wafer map data show that the new yield models provide significant improvement in yield estimation compared to the traditional Poisson model and negative binomial model.
The ultra-thin SiO2 is a major factor limiting the scaling of semiconductor devices. High-k gate dielectric materials such as HfO2 will replace SiO2 in future generations of MOS devices. This study investigates the two-step breakdown mechanisms and breakdown sequences of double-layered high-k gate stacks by monitoring the relaxation of the dielectric films.
The hazard rate is a widely used metric for measuring the reliability of electronic products. This dissertation studies the hazard rate function of gate dielectrics breakdown. A physically feasible failure time distribution is used to model the time-to-breakdown data and a Bayesian approach is adopted in the statistical analysis.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>FACULTY PERCEPTIONS OF THE FACTORS ENABLING  AND FACILITATING THEIR INTEGRATION OF  INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN TEACHING</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sturgeon, Charles Michael</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study employed a survey research design to identify factors that facilitate university faculty to integrate computer-based technologies into their teaching practice. The purpose of the study was to measure the practices and perceptions of higher education faculty toward instructional technology. The designed survey instrument established a series of five personal profile categories. The five categories were used as variables manipulated to enable a series of statistical analyses to examine factors that enable faculty to use technology in their teaching.  The survey was electronically administered to faculty in 36 universities in the Appalachian Region; a target population of approximately 4000 potential survey respondents.  A total of 427 faculty from 22 of these institutions responded to the survey, which was approximately 10% of the total population.
The findings, showed statistically significant correlations between the teaching with technology subscale and personal technology use subscale.  This may suggest that personal use and personal knowledge are indicators of whether or not university faculty will use technology in their teaching.  Additionally, a statistically significant difference was found between the extent to which female faculty reported using technology compared to male faculty members.  The generational factor (age), was not shown to have any significant relationship with the frequency of faculty members’ use of technology, but results indicated generational differences on the personal requirements profile.  Lastly, one finding related to the personal requirements profile indicated that the most common requirement for using technology reported by the faculty was the knowledge that doing so would enhance students’ learning.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Past Fire Regimes of Table Mountain Pine (&lt;em&gt;Pinus pungens L.&lt;/em&gt;) Stands in the Central Appalachian Mountains, Virginia, U.S.A.</dc:title>
<dc:creator>DeWeese, Georgina</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Table Mountain pine is an Appalachian endemic that occurs in a patchy distribution from Georgia to Pennsylvania and is prolific at sites with a history of fire disturbance. The purpose of this dissertation was to reconstruct the fire regimes of Table Mountain pine stands in the Jefferson National Forest, Virginia. Sections from firescarred Table Mountain pines were collected at four sites to analyze fire history, while increment cores and stand composition information were collected from macroplots within each fire history site to investigate the possible influence of fires that were more ecologically severe. Results show that fire was frequent before the fire suppression era, with a Weibull median fire return interval between 2–3 years. The majority of fires occurred during the dormant season and beginning of the early growing season. Two of the four sites had a more even distribution of fire seasons, and these sites also had significant Table Mountain pine regeneration. Cohorts of tree establishment were visible in the fire charts of three of these sites, indicating fires that were likely moderate in severity. The canopy at three of the four sites is currently dominated by Table Mountain pine, but the understory at all sites has large numbers of fire-intolerant hardwoods and shrubs. These Table Mountain pine stands will likely succeed to xeric oak and fireintolerant hardwoods, such as red maple and black gum, in the future. Fire statistics indicate that all four sites currently exist outside their range of historical variation in fire occurrence.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Evaluation of Forest Management to Improve Breeding Habitat for Songbirds in Oak-hickory Forests at Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Thatcher, Benjamin Stephen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Partners in Flight (PIF) recommends using silviculture to improve breeding habitat conditions for migrant landbirds. Alternative thinning treatments may benefit priority landbird species by increasing structural complexity in second-growth forests. However, the effects of thinning on landbird populations in oak (Quercus spp.)-hickory (Carya spp.) forests have not been experimentally demonstrated. I used a randomized and replicated large-scale manipulative experiment to evaluate the effects of thinning (i.e., crown-release and gap creation) on forest habitat characteristics and avian populations at the Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge. I collected data during 2001 (pre-treatment) and from 2002 to 2005 (1 to 4 years post-treatment) in 20-ha thinned (n = 8) and control (n = 4) plots. Using mixed model ANOVA with covariates, I compared habitat attributes, tree regeneration, avian population densities, daily nest survival rates, realized brood sizes (# fledged per successful nest), rates of brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) brood parasitism, and nest-site characteristics between treatments. In addition, I used Program MARK to evaluate the influence of habitat factors at multiple spatial scales on predation rates of Acadian flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) and wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) nests.
Forest habitat attributes, avian population densities, and nest survival rates did not differ between control and thinned plots prior to treatment, indicating my experimental design (including the random allocation of treatments to plots, blocking, and the interspersion of plots across the study area) was sufficient for detecting treatment effects. Thinning resulted in a 29% difference in basal area between treatments (thinned = 20.3 m2 ha-1; control = 28.5 m2 ha-1). Compared to controls, thinned plots had significantly less overstory cover and midstory cover and significantly more downed wood and herbaceous and woody vegetation in the lower forest strata. Specifically, I detected greater densities of oak (Quercus spp.), yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), and sourwood (Oxydenrum arboretum) saplings, and greater cover in poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans) and blackberry (Rubus spp.) in thinned than control plots.
I used spot-mapping to estimate the densities of PIF priority species. Thinning had positive effects on the densities of seven species (eastern towhee [Pipilo erythropthalmus], eastern-wood pewee [Contopus virens], indigo bunting [Passerina cyanea], Kentucky warbler [Oporornis formosus], white-eyed vireo [Vireo griseus], yellow-breasted chat [Icteria virens], and yellow-throated vireo [Vireo flavifrons]), inconclusive or negligible effects on the densities of two species (Louisiana waterthrush [Seiurus motacilla] and worm-eating warbler [Helmitheros vermivorus]), and negative effects on the densities of two species (Acadian flycatcher and wood thrush).
I monitored 1,149 nests of 28 species. Predation accounted for 80% of all nest failures. Mayfield-adjusted nest daily survival rates of all species combined did not significantly differ between treatments. For all species combined, rates of cowbird parasitism varied annually but did not significantly differ between thinned (20.8%, SE = 2.3) and control (18.5%, SE = 3.7) plots. I assigned bird species to functional groups for further analyses. PIF priority mature-forest species exhibited nest daily survival rates (0.972 vs. 0.969), realized brood sizes (2.8 vs. 2.6), and parasitism rates (16.9 vs. 10.4%) that were comparable between thinned and control plots. Based on 162 nests in thinned plots, PIF shrubland species had nest daily survival rates of 0.958, realized brood sizes of 2.9, and parasitism rates of 13.6%; this functional group nested too rarely in control plots for analysis. Treatment effects were significant for the overstory and midstory nesting functional groups. Overstory nesters exhibited nest daily survival rates that were greater in thinned (0.982) than control (0.963) plots. Midstory nesters experienced greater parasitism rates in thinned (30.0%) than control (17.9%) plots.
I evaluated nest-site selection and factors affecting nest predation rates using 132 Acadian flycatcher and 112 wood thrush nests. In thinned plots, both species selected nest sites with greater overstory and midstory cover than found at random. I found little evidence that nest predation rates were influenced by the amount of agriculture in the local (314 ha) landscape or by distance to anthropogenic edge, perhaps because the landscape was predominantly forested (agriculture &lt; 4%) and most nests were &gt;350 m from an edge. In thinned plots, predation rates on wood thrush nests decreased with increasing overstory cover and increasing basal area in large trees; predation rates increased with increasing basal area in small-diameter trees. None of the habitat predictors I measured had a strong relationship to Acadian flycatcher nest predation rates in thinned or control plots. Model-averaged nest survival estimates for wood thrushes were 27.8% and 26.8% in thinned and control plots, respectively. Acadian flycatcher model-averaged nest survival estimates were 53.5% in thinned and 56.4% in control plots.
In summary, my results indicate that thinning had strong effects on forest habitat attributes and the demographics of some priority bird species. In the short term (1 to 4 years post-treatment), thinning appears to provide suitable breeding habitat for priority bird species that prefer dense understory vegetation or partially-opened overstories for nesting. Conversely, thinning had neutral or negative effects on some species and functional groups that nest in midstory vegetation, indicating there may be an ecological cost, in the short-term, associated with implementing this treatment. This treatment likely will have differential costs and benefits for avian populations as forest habitat conditions continue responding via successional dynamics and vegetative growth to the initial thinning operation.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Mindfulness: Mediating the Relationship between Attachment Security and Parenting Style</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Haag, Ian P</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The current project examines the relationships between attachment security, parenting style, and mindfulness. The level of mindfulness an individual demonstrates is argued to mediate the relationship between an individual’s attachment security and her respective parenting style. The population is composed of 35 mothers who were drawn from a university clinic setting. Measures utilized included: the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ), which measures adult attachment security, the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), which measures the level of mindfulness an individual demonstrates, and the Parental Authority Questionnaire – Revised (PAQ-R), which measures parenting style attitudes. Results demonstrated no significant relationships between attachment security and parenting style. In examining the relationship between attachment security and mindfulness, individuals designated securely attached demonstrated higher levels of mindfulness than their insecure counterparts. With respect to mindfulness and its relationship with parenting style, mindfulness was positively correlated with an authoritative parenting style but did not demonstrate a significant relationship with either an authoritarian or a permissive parenting style. A test of mediation was conducted to examine the relationship between attachment security and parenting style, with mindfulness as the mediator. The model evidenced a significant reduction in the relationship between attachment security and an authoritative parenting style, suggesting that mindfulness successfully mediated this relationship. Mediation was not found in the case of the permissive and authoritarian styles. Discussions of the methodological approach, the implications of these findings, and future directions for research are presented.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Strong Spin Orbital Coupling Effect on Magnetic Field Response Generated by Intermolecular Excited States in Organic Semiconductors</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Yan, Liang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>It has been found that non-magnetic organic semiconductors can show some magnetic responses in low magnetic field (&lt;100 &gt;mT). When applying magnetic field, the electroluminescence, electrical current, photocurrent, and photoluminescence could change with magnetic field, which are called magnetic field effects.
Magnetic field effects are generated through spin-dependent process affected by the internal magnetic interaction. In nonmagnetic materials, hyperfine interaction has been supposed to dominantly affect the spin-dependent process recently.  But the conclusion was made in weak spin-orbital coupling organic semiconductor. The hyperfine interaction might not be the main reason responsible for magnetic field effects in strong spin-orbital coupling materials. Therefore, the study of magnetic field effects in strong spin-orbital coupling organic semiconductor is important to get a whole view of the origin of the magnetic field effects in nonmagnetic organic semiconductors.
This dissertation will clarify the generation mechanism of magnetic field effect in nonmagnetic organic semiconductors and further explore how the strong spin-orbital coupling affecting the magnetic field effect.
It has been found the intermolecular excited states are important inter-median for magnetic field effects. The change of intersystem crossing at intermolecular excited states will change the singlet/triplet ratio and further generate magnetic field effects through different recombination and dissociation properties of singlet and triplet intermolecular excited states.
Both the energy transfer effect coupled spin orbital coupling and energy transfer effect free spin orbital-coupling are discussed in the dissertation. The tuning of the magnetic field effect by adjusting the spin-orbital coupling is also established through distance effect and interface effect. It has been found that changing inter-molecular spin-orbital coupling is a critical factor to generate magnetic field effects in organic semiconductors. And the sensitivity of different magnetic field effects to strong spin-orbital coupling strength is depending on the final product.
The internal magnetic interaction can be hyperfine interaction, spin orbital coupling and spin-spin interaction between electrons. The hyperfine interaction and spin orbital coupling are important in nonmagnetic organic semiconductors. But the electron spin-spin interaction is important in magnetic organic semiconductors. The magnetocurrent for magnetic and nonmagnetic organic semiconductors at different temperature has been compared.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Synthesis and Characterization of Atomically Dispersed, Vanadosilicate Catalysts in Si8O20-Based Building Block Solids</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lee, Ming-Yung</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Silica supported vanadium complexes have attracted interest as catalysts for a variety of catalytic reactions in the past two decades. Although many strategies have been developed for incorporating vanadyl species on silica surfaces, controlling dispersion and loading while simultaneously producing single site catalysts remains a challenging goal in this context and in catalysis as well.
A simple strategy for producing single-site and site-isolated vanadyl species has been explored which allows for control of both the connectivity to the support as well as the local surface structure around a V=O group. The main elements of this strategy involve construction of the support from silicate building blocks linked by groups that both hold the matrix together and act as catalytically active sites. Controlled sequential dosing lead to catalysts in which control of the identity of the sites, their connectivity to the support and dispersion is maintained. The specific system that will be described involves the controlled reaction of vanadyl chloride (VOCl3) and vanadium tetrachloride (VCl4) with the tin functionallized spherosilicate cube, (SnMe3)8Si8O20. Labeled 17O (SnMe3*O)8Si8O12 and (Cl3Si)8Si8O20 molecule have also been synthesized successfully by using totally new synthetic methodologies. The physico-chemical properties of these vanadium catalysts were characterized by solid state 51V and 17O NMR, gravimetric analysis, EXAFS, and atomic absorption spectroscopy.
A quick survey of isopropanol dehydration and dehydrogenation with these vanadium (IV and V) catalysts has been studies. The acid-base property of these single-site and site-isolated catalysts has been assessed by the conversion of isopropanol. Preliminary results of highly selectivity (&gt;97%) of isopropanol conversion to propene will be described.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Relationship Between Experiential Variables and the Occurence of Duodenal Ulcer</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lothrop, William W</dc:creator>
<dc:description>INTRODUCTION The research about to be reported is part of a larger research program with duodenal ulcer patients carried out at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, under the direction of Drs. Gerald R. Pascal. and William O. Jenkins of the University of Tennessee Psychology Department. This research program has attempted to bring a systematic, behaviorally-oriented approach to the problem ot duodenal ulcer. The early work of Bergmann (3) has been followed by sufficient expermental research, notably that of Wolf and Wolff (28), Mittelmann and Wolff (16), Gantt (8) and Sawrey (24, 25), to make tentative the hypothesis that there is what may be called a psychogenic factor in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulcer. This hypothesis seems to have been commonly accepted into both medical and psychological thinking. Twenty-six years ago, in fact, Cushing observed that most medical men of that day recognized that &quot;high-strung&quot; individuals were more susceptible to nervous indigestion and peptic ulcer, that the ulcer symptoms became quiescent or even tended to heal when the patients were put mentally and physically at rest, and that these symptoms tended to recur as soon as the patient resumed his former tasks and responsibilities (6). Despite its widespread acceptance, however, the precise relationship of this psychogenic factor to the physiology of duodenal ulcer has not been clearly understood, nor has this psychogenic factor itself been acceptably defined.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Reading in the Content Area: Its Impact on Teaching in the Social Studies Classroom</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wilson, Peter A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study focused on evaluating the sufficiency of research in reading in the content area used to instruct classroom teachers. The research used was conducted between 1970 and 2000 and incorporated into textbooks written between 1975 and 2005. Studies examined were those reported in the following journals: Review of Educational Research, Review of Research in Education, Social Education, Theory and Research in Social Education, Reading Research Quarterly, and Research in the Teaching of English. Some attention was also given to two major educational curriculum and issue journals- Educational Leadership and Phi Delta Kappan as these sources might identify relevant research studies for further investigation. References cited in more than one text helped identify and establish a baseline of those studies considered most significant by textbook authors.
The findings of this study showed that the majority of citations looked at the following themes: -Learners acquire meaning from the printed page through thought. -Reading can and should be done for different purposes using a variety of materials. -A number of techniques can be used to teach reading skills. -Reading materials need to be selected according to changes in a child‘s interests. -Reading ability is the level of reading difficulty that students can cope with. It depends on ability rather than age or grade level. -Readability contributes to both the reader‘s degree of comprehension and the need for teacher assistance when reading difficulty exceeds the reader‘s capability. -Reading instruction, in some form, needs to be carried on into the secondary grades.
Research findings from the 1970s were concerned with reading strategies, reading skills, reading comprehension, readability, attitudes towards reading, vocabulary, study skills, and content area reading programs.
In the 1980s research cited in content area reading books looked at reading comprehension, reading skills, vocabulary, learning strategies, curriculum issues, purposes for reading and writing, content area reading programs, readability, schema theory, thinking skills, summarizing, comprehension strategies, and cooperative learning.
By the 1990s more research cited in content area reading books focused on reading strategies, curriculum issues, how to read documents and graphs, reading skills, vocabulary, attitudes towards reading, reading comprehension, and activating background knowledge.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Shu, Xiang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Dynamic modulus (|E*|) of HMA mixtures is one of the fundamental engineering properties measured by the Simple Performance Tester (SPT) and has been incorporated as a basic input parameter in the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) 2002 Mechanistic-Empirical (M-E) Design Guide for flexible pavement design. Although direct laboratory testing and empirical equations (such as the Witczak model and the Hirsch model) provide two ways to obtain the values of dynamic modulus of HMA mixtures, a predictive model based on the microstructure of HMA mixtures is more desirable.
HMA mixtures consist of three phases: aggregate, asphalt binder (or mastic), and air voids. During the blending process of HMA mixtures, every aggregate particle, regardless of its size, is coated with a thin film of asphalt mastic. Therefore, the resulting mixture can be considered as a particulate-filled composite (PFC) with aggregate particles dispersed in the asphalt matrix. Consequently, the theoretical approaches for PFC can be applied to HMA mixtures.
This study presents an attempt to apply PFC models to predict the dynamic modulus of HMA mixtures. A three-dimensional two-layered model and several models from the differential method were developed and formulated. These PFC models have the ability to take into account the particular characteristics of HMA mixtures: the viscoelastic nature, aggregate gradation, and air voids.
Laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate the applicability of the newly developed and some currently existing PFC models to HMA mixtures. Dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) testing was conducted on asphalt binder and mastic for their dynamic shear moduli. HMA mixture was tested for its dynamic modulus.
PFC models were first applied to predict dynamic shear modulus of asphalt mastic with the measured dynamic shear modulus of asphalt binder as input parameter. The predicted dynamic shear moduli of asphalt mastic from all PFC models were fairly close to the measured results. Then, the PFC models were used to predict the dynamic modulus of HMA mixtures with dynamic shear modulus of asphalt binder or mastic as an input parameter. The predicted dynamic modulus values of HMA mixtures were found to deviate from the measured data to varying degrees.
The reasons for the discrepancy between the predicted and measured dynamic moduli were analyzed. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the effects of different factors on dynamic modulus of HMA mixtures.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Reliability Analysis of Hafnium Oxide Dielectric Based Nanoelectronics</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wan, Rui</dc:creator>
<dc:description>With the physical dimensions ever scaling down, the increasing level of sophistication in nano-electronics requires a comprehensive and multidisciplinary reliability investigation. A kind of nano-devices, HfO2-based high-k dielectric films, are studied in the statistical aspect of reliability as well as electrical and physical aspects of reliability characterization, including charge trapping and degradation mechanisms, breakdown modes and bathtub failure rate estimation.
This research characterizes charge trapping and investigates degradation mechanisms in high-k dielectrics. Positive charges trapped in both bulk and interface contribute to the interface state generation and flat band voltage shift when electrons are injected from the gate under a negative gate bias condition.A negligible number of defects are generated until the stress voltage increases to a certain level. As results of hot electrons and positive charges trapped in the interface region, the difference in the breakdown sequence is attributed to the physical thickness of the bulk high-k layer and the structure of the interface layer.
Time-to-breakdown data collected in the accelerated life tests are modeled with a bathtub failure rate curve by a 3-step Bayesian approach. Rather than individually considering each stress level in accelerating life tests (ALT), this approach derives the change point and the priors for Bayesian analysis from the time-to-failure data under neighborhood stresses, based on the relationship between the lifetime and stress voltage. This method can provide a fast and reliable estimation of failure rate for burn-in optimization when only a small sample of data is available.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Attachment Representations and Reflective Function in Women with Borderline Personality Disorder and their Adolescent Offspring</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Fitzpatrick, Katie Lauren</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by significant disruptions in development, including but not limited to the development of attachment representations and a capacity to reflect on mental states of self and other. For the individual with BPD, these disruptions may greatly impact the development of her offspring, including an increased risk of the child developing borderline psychopathology. Examining the attachment representations and the reflective capacity of the offspring of women with BPD can add to the understanding of developmental pathways to pathology and resilience. In particular, assessing for BPD-related patterns in attachment representations, narrative coherence, and reflective functioning in adolescent offspring may be especially illuminating as it is in adolescence that BPD can first be diagnosed. It is also in adolescence when attachment representations can begin to be measured most directly given the cognitive capacities gained by this developmental period. The body of parent-offspring attachment research that exists to date has focused primarily upon infant-parent relationships. Minimal research has explored adolescent-parent relationships. The current study examines a low socioeconomic status sample of 20 adolescents and their mothers where the mothers are diagnosed with BPD and a sample of 19 matched comparison adolescents and their mothers on: adult/adolescent attachment representations, the capacity for reflective functioning, and coherence in discourse regarding early attachment-related experiences. Measures utilized include: the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI), which measures attachment representations of adults and adolescents, and the Reflective Functioning (RF) coding system, which measures the capacity to understand self and others in terms of mental states. Results demonstrated no significant relationships between BPD and comparison groups on two-way or four-way attachment classification for mothers or their adolescent offspring. A marginally significant difference was found between groups of mothers on the capacity for RF. No such difference was detected between groups for adolescents. Narrative coherence as measured by the AAI was not found to be correlated between mothers and adolescents. Finally, affect instability, a main feature of BPD, was not found to be correlated with RF capacity. The implications of these findings, the methods used, and suggested future directions for research are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Regulation of Herpetic Stromal Keratitis: Role of Regulatory T Cells</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sehrawat, Sharvan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK) is an immunoinflammatory corneal lesion caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. One of the dire consequences of which is blindness resulting from tissue destructive immunopathological reaction in corneal stroma. The lesion is considered to be orchestrated mainly by CD4+ T cells of Th1 phenotype. Studies on two animal models viz. immunocompetent and immunodeficient, shed light on the issues on specificity of the cells which at least in immunocomprised TCR transgenic animals were shown to be activated in a bystander manner. However, initial infiltration by innate immune cells in response to replicating virus set the stage for the chronic inflammation in the corneal stroma. Paradoxically, these cells are also critical in the control of virus in the cornea.
The first part (Part I) of this dissertation focuses on the understanding of HSV-1 induced immunoinflammatory processes in the cornea and trigeminal ganglia including the secondary lymphoid tissues and the involvement of regulatory mechanisms. The next three parts (Part II-IV) focus on the control of the inflammatory lesion and anti-inflammatory mechanisms that are activated following virus infection in the lymphoid organs and cornea. Results in Part II evaluate the immunotherapeutic potential of regulatory T cells in controlling the progression of the inflammatory lesions after ocular HSV infection. Results of the third section show that sequestration of T effector cells in the lymphoid organs and limited access to site of inflammation using a drug FTY720 after HSV infection resulted in diminished severity of SK and expansion of antigen-specific regulatory T cells that could contribute to the diminution of lesion severity. The fourth section describes the role of a previously unexplored inhibitory interaction between a Th1 specific cell surface marker, TIM-3 and its ligand galectin-9 in the causation of the viral induced corneal immunopathology. The administration of galectin-9 seemed to be an effective approach to terminate Th1 responses and promote regulatory cells activity thereby controlling the severity of lesions.
In this study, experiments were designed to control the progression of the ongoing inflammatory reaction in the cornea in order to evaluate some of the therapeutic strategies for HSK.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Vertically Aligned Carbon Nanofiber Arrays as a Platform for Gene Delivery and Expression Analysis in Mammalian Cells</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Mann, David George James</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Vertically aligned carbon nanofiber (VACNF) arrays have been developed as a novel tool for direct physical introduction and expression of DNA in mammalian cells (termed impalefection). This study describes the optimization of impalefection, the quantification of immobilized DNA on VACNFs, and the application of VACNFs in analysing gene expression in mammalian cells. Mechanical, chemical and biological parameters were optimized for impalefection. Alterations in a majority of the parameters resulted in no significant difference in impalefection efficiency, including nanofiber composition, DNA precipitation, cell confluency, cell concentration and sodium butyrate. The optimal DNA concentration ranged between 100 nanograms and 1 microgram, and the optimal impalefection substrate proved to be a Durx filter pad on plastic surface. High levels of efficiency in a wide range of mammalian cell lines demonstrated the versatile applicability of the impalefection method. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in-vitro transcription (IVT) were used to investigate the transcriptional accessibility of immobilized DNA on VACNF arrays by correlating the yields of both IVT and PCR to that of non-immobilized DNA. Quantitative PCR was used to quantify the number of accessible yfp reporter gene copies immobilized to nanofiber arrays. DNA yields decreased dramatically in the non-immobilized control over time, while the majority of immobilized DNA was retained on VACNF arrays. These data demonstrated the development of methods for monitoring DNA immobilization techniques. To validate the applicability of VACNF arrays for controlling and monitoring mammalian gene expression, a tetracycline-inducible shRNA vector system was designed for silencing CFP expression and was impalefected into mammalian cells. VACNF arrays provided simultaneous delivery of multiple genes, subsequent adherence and proliferation of cells, and repeated monitoring of single cells over time. Following impalefection and tetracycline induction, 53.1% ± 10.4% of impalefected cells were fully silenced by the inducible shRNA vector. Additionally, efficient CFP-silencing was observed in single cells among a population of cells that remained CFP-expressing. This effective transient expression system enabled rapid analysis of gene silencing effects using RNAi in single cells and cell populations.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Effects of Betrayal Characteristics on Laypeople’s Ratings of Betrayal Severity and Conceptualization of Forgiveness</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Dixon, Lee J.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The two studies included in this project were aimed at understanding the effect that relational closeness has on perceived ease of forgiveness and betrayal severity and, in turn, how betrayal severity and relational closeness influence people’s conceptualization of forgiveness. Study 1 addressed the fact that although past studies have shown that relational closeness predicts one’s willingness to forgive and researchers have posited that betrayals that are committed by those closest are the most severe, it is still unclear whether these trends are due to the characteristics of close relationships or to the characteristics of the types of betrayals that are committed within close relationships.
Two randomized groups of college undergraduates imagined the same betrayal narratives being committed by either someone relationally close or someone relationally distant. As was expected, imagining someone close led to participants viewing the betrayals as easier to forgive. However, contrary to what was expected, participants who imagined the betrayals being committed by someone close viewed the betrayals as less severe.
Together, these findings suggest that it is not the characteristics of the betrayals being committed in close relationships, but the qualities of the relationship that affect the perceived severity of betrayals as well as how easy they are to forgive. Study 2 addressed the notion that people’s conceptualization of forgiveness may vary as a function of the closeness of the betrayer and the severity of the offense. College undergraduates read one of six betrayal narratives taken from the first study that varied in both severity and the relational closeness of the imagined betrayer. Results indicated that participants expected a more positive outcome from the forgiveness of less severe betrayals as well as betrayals that were committed by someone relationally close. The interaction of these two constructs demonstrated that relational closeness has less influence on one’s conceptualization of forgiveness of less severe betrayals. The results of this second study suggest that forgiveness is not a completely static construct and that its conceptualization is dependent upon both who committed the betrayal as well as the severity of the betrayal in question. Implications, limitations, and future directions are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Cognitive Effects of Cosmetic Surgery Reality Shows – From a Priming Perspective</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lee, Shu-Yueh</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study applied priming theory to investigate the cognitive effects of cosmetic surgery reality shows. An experimental design was utilized to demonstrate the effects of cosmetic surgery reality shows on viewers‟ perceptions regarding cosmetic surgery, physically unattractive people, and the beliefs of beauty. One experimental group was exposed to cosmetic surgery reality shows and two control groups were exposed to non-cosmetic surgery reality shows. This study found strong and assimilative priming effects. After being primed with cosmetic surgery reality shows, viewers perceived greater benefits of cosmetic surgery in terms of competitiveness, confidence, appearance, happiness, and attractiveness. They also perceived lower surgical risks and perceived good-looking people as more privileged in romantic relationships and in the job market. Meanwhile, physically unattractive people were considered as being disadvantaged in social relations. Habitual makeover show viewing had no effects on the perceived benefits and risks of cosmetic surgery. It had more profound effects on perceptions of physically unattractive people and the power of beauty. Body anxiety, unexpectedly, did not moderate the effects of exposure to cosmetic surgery reality shows.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Establishment, Growth, Spread, and Ecological Impacts of &lt;em&gt;Microstegium vimineum&lt;/em&gt; in Central Hardwood Forests</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Marshall, Jordan M.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Microstegium vimineum is an annual exotic grass common through the Southeastern United States. Adding M. vimineum to native plant communities may alter future forest composition through inhibiting the growth and influencing recruitment of seedlings into larger size classes, as well as significantly altering vertical structure and community richness, which may influence the distribution of insects.
The main objectives of these studies were to 1) establish how different mineral soil and litter disturbances, in combination with various forest canopy coverage, influence the establishment, growth, and spread of M. vimineum, 2) quantify effects of competition between M. vimineum and native hardwood seedlings, and 3) identify the influence of M. vimineum on insect community structure and distribution.
As percent canopy cover decreased, M. vimineum mean length and mean number of nodes increased. Also, as soil temperature and soil moisture increased, M. vimineum percent cover increased. Individual seedlings spread further from established populations in both the litter removal and the mineral soil disturbance and litter removal treatments than in the control. The apparent connection between soil disturbance and invasion by M. vimineum provides further impetus for careful planning and use of haul road and skid trails.
There was a reduction in A. rubrum and L. tulipifera leaf area as a result of competition with M. vimineum, which was likely due to competition for moisture. Quercus rubra did not display any differences in leaf characteristics as a result of M. vimineum competition. As a result of reductions in growth for A. rubrum and L. tulipifera, competitive impacts imposed by M. vimineum may alter the rate at which these species are recruited into larger size classes. This may change future forest composition, and have ecological and economic consequences.
In areas with M. vimineum, there were significantly more insects collected than in areas without M. vimineum. These increases in abundance likely resulted from 2.5 times greater plant cover due to the addition of M. vimineum to the plant communities. However, it should be noted that focusing on a single taxonomic group, such as insects, might not provide an adequate measure of exotic species impacts.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Exploring the Relationship Between Orpda and Teachers' Conceptual Understanding of Place Value</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Price, Jamie Howard</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this case study was to understand whether or not the use of an invented number system, called Orpda, helped teachers develop a deeper understanding of place value in hopes that this will translate into their own teaching of place value concepts. Thirteen teachers enrolled in a graduate mathematics education course served as the participants for this study.  Data were collected from teachers’ reflections on various activities related to Orpda, pre- and post-Orpda concept maps teachers created, online discussions between the teachers, teacher demographic sheets, and an interview with the instructor of the course.
Analysis of the teachers' reflections revealed that Orpda increased teachers’ attention to three critical components necessary for developing a conceptual understanding of place value, namely unitizing, regrouping, and recognizing the meaning of different place values within a multi-digit number.  In addition, Orpda encouraged teachers to reflect on their own teaching of place value.  Comparing the structures of the teachers' pre-Orpda and post-Orpda concept maps showed changes in some cases but did not reveal clear patterns.  Analysis of the categories teachers included in pre- and post-Orpda maps revealed that teachers were moving from a procedural to a more conceptual view of place value, as did the analysis of squared adjacency matrices created from each teacher's pre- and post-Orpda concept maps.
Four conclusions can be drawn from this study:  (a) Orpda increased teachers' attention to the importance of unitizing in place value, (b) Orpda encouraged teachers to reflect deeply on their thinking, (c) Concept maps show promise for revealing and documenting changes in conceptual understanding, and (d) Orpda increased teachers' attention to the importance of patterns in understanding place value.  Further research is needed using Orpda with different groups and numbers of teachers, and in different settings, e.g., longer full semesters and teacher professional development meetings. Research exploring the use of follow-up interviews to accompany concept maps and enhance the assessment of conceptual understanding is also recommended.  This study indicates two recommendations for practice in teacher education, the importance of a classroom environment that supports reflection, and the careful choosing of activities to provide appropriate challenge.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Nanomagnets: Magnetic Properties and Inelastic Neutron Scattering Studies</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Haraldsen, Jason T</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this thesis, small quantum spin systems, known as nano-magnets or molecular magnets, have been investigated. This is an area of great interest in the development of nanotechnology and quantum computers. Previous research on molecular magnets has concentrated on large, complex materials, which have many magnetic ions competing for superexchange pathways. Due to the large number of magnetic ions, the Hamiltonians resulted in very large Hilbert spaces, which makes it difficult for the magnetic interactions to be characterized and analyzed. Through the analysis of smaller and simpler magnetic clusters, insight can be gained from the interactions of the magnetic ions in these systems. Because many quantum spin systems can be accurately modeled using an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we will assume this as a starting point for the theoretical description of molecular magnets.
Our previous work on these systems considered only clusters of S=1/2 ions. Here, we derived closed form results for the magnetothermal properties and inelastic neutron scattering structure factors for dimers, trimers, and tetramers in various geometries, and in several cases were able to compare these calculations to known molecular magnets, and assist in the identification of the dominant magnetic interaction pathways.
Using similar methods, these results are extended to clusters of two to six ions of spin S. An analysis of magnetic properties and observables for these clusters reveal a distinct pattern for that may be useful for the understanding of large clusters that cannot be determined analytically. From the specific case examined, the analysis of data from experiments on some magnetic materials shows the use and need for these calculations. This study of magnetic interactions in small quantum magnets develops clearer insight into the nature of excitations of larger, more complicated systems, which at present can only be investigated phenomenologically or through the use of numerical methods.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Teacher Attitudes Toward English Language Learners</dc:title>
<dc:creator>McKinney, Rich W</dc:creator>
<dc:description>No Child Left Behind (NCLB) has created a situation in which teachers are required to educate English Language Learners (ELLs) at the same level of proficiency as native speakers. However, there is a paucity of research concerning teacher attitudes regarding ELLs, and thus, little is known about how these attitudes will impact instruction. The purpose of this study was to examine regular education teachers’ attitudes toward the inclusion of ELLs in the regular education classroom. More specifically this study sought to understand whether teacher attitudes were influenced by the specific instructional factors of support, expertise, and time.
The study was conducted in conjunction with a large, metropolitan school system in Tennessee. In the study, several schools were selected based on their ELL populations over the past three years. Teachers at these schools were invited to participate in the study, and were asked to respond to a survey instrument which was adapted from the Opinions Relative to Integration (ORI). The adapted ORI was used to quantify teacher attitudes regarding the inclusion of ELLs in regular education classrooms, and the results were subsequently used to generate an index score of teacher acceptance of ELLs in the regular education classroom. Additionally, teachers were asked to respond to a survey instrument which examined whether the teacher felt they had the necessary amounts of support, expertise, and time to teach ELLs.
The data were analyzed using a three-way ANOVA, and the results suggest that teachers’ attitudes are influenced by a scarcity of instructional factors. This paper discusses the extent to which the three specific instructional factors of support, expertise, and time influenced teacher attitudes. Additionally, the paper considers how educational leaders might use these findings to improve teacher attitudes toward ELLs.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Non-market Valuation of Natural Resource Amenities: Assessing their Effects on Human Values, Public Health, and the Economic Growth</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Poudyal, Neelam C.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Rural landscapes in the United States have changed substantially in recent years due to increased urbanization, and an ever-increasing demand for consumptive and nonconsumptive uses of natural resources. At the same time, we are facing new challenges regarding the socio-economic well-being of people and the ecological significance of resources in the landscape. Previous research in natural resources economics and management has failed to recognize the role of natural resources amenities in fostering economic growth, human values, and public welfare. Applying various non-market valuation techniques to real world observations, the findings from the essays in this dissertation add to the valuation aspects of natural resources economics literature, and reveal some policy implications for local, state, and federal governments.
The first essay investigates the potential of promoting natural resource amenities as a rural economic growth engine. The second investigates how the variation, spatial distribution, and configuration of landuse features are valued in urban neighborhoods. The third essay estimates the demand for public lands in urban areas and analyzes the anticipated economic welfare gain of policies supplying such public lands. The fourth essay extends the existing model of the life expectancy production function to evaluate the role of environmental amenities in promoting public health. The final essay assesses the effects of the ongoing landuse changes and urban sprawl on the demand for wildlife hunting and related nature-based recreation in rural America.
Since the recent approaches of conservation and development emphasize passive employment of natural resources for sustainable development; the essays in this iv dissertation present some insights into recognizing the value of natural resources in economic growth, human values, public health, and recreational prospects in the United States. In addition to providing policy implications, essays in this dissertation extend or improve some of the existing models and methodological frameworks of non-market valuation.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Dynamics of polymeric solutions in complex kinematics bulk and free surface flows: Multiscale/Continuum simulations and experimental studies</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Abedijaberi, Arash</dc:creator>
<dc:description>While rheological and microstructural complexities have posed tremendous challenges to researchers in developing first principles models and simulation techniques that can accurately and robustly predict the dynamical behaviour of polymeric flows, the past two decades have offered several significant advances towards accomplishing this goal. These accomplishments include: (1).  Stable and accurate formulation of continuum-level viscoelastic constitutive models and their efficient implementation using operator splitting methods to explore steady and transient flows in complex geometries, (2). Prediction of rheology of polymer solutions and melts based on micromechanical models as well as highly parallel self-consistent multiscale simulations of non-homogeneous flows. The main objective of this study is to leverage and build upon the aforementioned advances to develop a quantitative understanding of the flow-micro-structure coupling mechanisms in viscoelastic polymeric fluids and in turn predict, consistent with experiments, their essential macroscopic flow properties e.g. frictional drag, interface shape, etc. To this end, we have performed extensive continuum and multiscale flow simulations in several industrially relevant bulk and free surface flows. The primary motivation for the selection of the specific flow problems is based on their ability to represent different deformation types, and the ability to experimentally verify the simulation results as well as their scientific and industrial significance.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Importance of Chain Connectivity in the Formation of Non-covalent Interactions between Polymers and Single-walled Carbon Nanotubes and its Impact on Dispersion</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Linton, Dias</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Polymer nanocomposites have garnered incredible promise in the field of material science due to the excellent mechanical strength, thermal and electrical conductivities of the nanoparticles and the extension of these properties to the processing flexibility inherent to plastics. However, practical realization of these nanoparticle-based materials has been hindered by the tendency of these nanoparticles to aggregate as a result of strong inter-particle forces. In this dissertation, we investigate the formation of non-covalent charge transfer interactions between polymers and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with the goal of optimizing interfacial adhesion and homogeneity of nanocomposites without modifying the SWNT native surface.
Nanocomposites of SWNTs and three sets of polymer matrices with varying composition of electron donating or electron accepting functional groups were prepared. In the first part of this dissertation, quantitative characterization by optical microscopy and Raman spectroscopy and qualitative results through thick film composite visualization show that the existence of a moderate amount of interacting moieties along the polymer chain results in an enhanced intermolecular interaction with SWNT, which translates to an optimum nanoparticle homogeneity.
Calculations from density functional theory and Flory-Huggins theory correlate with the experimental results, which illustrate that chain connectivity is critical in controlling the accessibility of the functional groups to form intermolecular interactions. Thus, controlling the amount of interacting functional groups throughout the polymer chain such that an adequate distance between them is realized will direct the extent of charge transfer interaction, which enables tuning the SWNT dispersion.
The second part of this dissertation focuses on the elucidation of the morphology of these nanoparticle entities in a polymer matrix. The observance of microphase-separated peaks in the scattering patterns of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanocomposites indicate an ordering of the PAN polymer induced by the carbon nanotube cage, which could either be due to a thermodynamically bound layer around the SWNT or the occurrence of SWNT-induced PAN crystallization.
Finally, UV-Vis measurements were performed on SWNT-polymer suspension in order to comprehend the interactions that occur during nanocomposite fabrication. These results demonstrate that SWNT dispersions in pure N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) are stabilized by the adsorption of polymers onto the SWNTs.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Behavioral Activation of Religious Behaviors:  Treating Depressed College Students with a Randomized Controlled Trial</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Armento, Maria Elizabeth Anne</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Abstract
Although spiritual or religious behaviors are sometimes targeted within behavioral activation protocols (Hopko &amp; Lejuez, 2007; Hopko, Lejuez, Ruggiero, &amp; Eifert, 2003), the efficacy of a protocol that exclusively develops a religiously-based behavioral repertoire has not been investigated. This randomized controlled study investigated the efficacy of a brief protocol for religious action in behavioral activation (PRA-BA) relative to a no-treatment “support” condition among mild to moderately depressed undergraduate students (n = 50). PRA-BA consisted of an individualized one-session intervention and 2-week activation interval. Clinical outcomes assessed depression, environmental reward, anxiety, and quality of life. Repeated measures ANOVAs indicated that the PRA-BA group had significantly greater decreases in depression and anxiety and increases in environmental reward at post-treatment. There was also a statistical trend indicating that PRA-BA may improve quality of life. At one-month follow-up, treatment gains were maintained for the PRA-BA participants. This study provides encouraging support for the efficacy of a strictly religiously-based behavioral intervention toward attenuating symptoms of depression in college students.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Balancing Student Participation in Large College Courses via Randomized Credit for Participation</dc:title>
<dc:creator>McCleary, Daniel Fox</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The current study was an extension of research reported by Krohn (2010), which showed that daily credit for self-reported participation in designated credit units tended to balance participation across students (i.e., fewer non-participants, more credit-level participants, and fewer dominant participants).  The purpose of the current study was to determine if similar results would be achieved by randomly selecting half of the discussion days in designated credit units for participation credit.
The study was done in 3 large sections of an undergraduate class (approximately 54 students per class).  Students self-recorded their in-class comments each day on specially designed record cards.  At the end of each pre-selected unit, instructors randomly selected discussion days and awarded credit based on the number of comments made on the days randomly selected.  Three credit points were given for each student’s first comment and two additional points for a second comment.
The findings of the current study differed in several ways from those of Krohn’s (2010) comparison study.  The differences mainly related to baseline percentages of different levels of participation.  Compared to the current study, Krohn’s study had a higher percentage of non-participants, fewer credit-level participants, fewer frequent participants, and more dominant participants. The disparities between the baseline levels of Krohn’s study and the current study made treatment effects more difficult to achieve in the latter study.  Nonetheless, there were fewer non-participants and more credit-level and frequent participants during credit units than in non-credit units.
Secondarily, a survey was given at the beginning of the course to analyze student beliefs regarding participation.  Using the same survey, Krohn (2010) extracted three primary factors: 1) Personal Benefits of Participation, 2) Expectation for Discussion in College Classes, and 3) Personal History and Confidence Regarding Participation.  The same three factors were also examined separately and in combination in the current study.  Results showed the three-factor model to predict student participation levels better than the total survey.  In addition, students were given the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal at the onset of the course.  A logistic regression indicated that exam and critical thinking scores, in combination, significantly predicted student participation levels.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Microscopy Techniques for Investigating Interactions in Microbial Systems</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Edwards, Amanda Nicole</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Biological interactions occur on multiple length scales, ranging from molecular to population wide interactions. This work describes the study of two specific areas of biological interactions in microbial systems: intracellular protein-protein interactions and cell-to-cell interactions. The implementation of optical and atomic force microscopy and the methodologies developed during this study proved to be invaluable tools for investigating these systems.
Identifying and characterizing protein interactions are fundamental steps toward understanding complex cellular networks.  We have developed a unique methodology which combines an imaging-based protein interaction assay with a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching technique (FRAP). Protein interactions are readily detected by co-localization of two proteins of interest fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and DivIVA, a cell division protein from Bacillus subtilis.  We demonstrate that the modified co-localization assay is sensitive enough to detect protein interactions over four orders of magnitude.  FRAP data was analyzed using a combination of various image processing techniques and analytical models.  This combined approach made it possible to estimate cell morphology parameters such as length, diameter, the effective laser probe volume, as well as to the mobile protein concentration in vivo, the number of bound molecules at the cellular poles, and the biophysical parameter koff.
Cells not only utilize molecular interactions in the intracellular environment, but also express proteins, polysaccharides and other complex molecules to mediate interactions with the surrounding extracellular environment. In Azospirillum brasilense, cell surface properties, including exopolysaccharide production, are thought to play a direct role in promoting cell-to-cell interactions. Recently, the Che1 chemotaxis-like pathway from A. brasilense was shown to modulate flocculation, suggesting an associated modulation of cell surface properties. Using atomic force microscopy, distinct changes in the surface morphology of flocculating A. brasilense Che1 mutant strains were detected. Further analyses suggest that the extracellular matrix differs between the cheA1 and the cheY1 deletion mutants, despite similarity in the macroscopic floc structures. Collectively, these data indicate that disruption of the Che1 pathway is correlated with distinctive changes in the extracellular matrix, which likely result from changes in surface polysaccharides structure and/or composition.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Determination of Mineral Abundances in Ordinary Chondrites Using Powder X-ray Diffraction: Applications to Parent Body Processes and Asteroid Spectroscopy</dc:title>

<dc:description>The ordinary chondrites, the most abundant group of meteorites, are divided into three chemical groups (H, L, and LL), which are distinguished based on variations in bulk composition and iron content. Although ordinary chondrites are relatively abundant, our understanding of their formation has been hampered by an inability to accurately measure the abundances of minerals that they contain. Here I use power x-ray diffraction (XRD) to quantify the modal abundances of 48 unbrecciated ordinary chondrite falls, which represent the complete petrologic range of equilibrated ordinary chondrites (types 4-6).
Although the degree of metamorphism varies within each ordinary chondrite group, many details regarding the geochemical and thermal changes that take place during this process are not well understood. Using XRD-measured modal mineral abundances and chemical analyses, we evaluate the redox state and peak metamorphic temperatures in ordinary chondrite parent bodies in order to develop quantitative thermal evolution models of ordinary chondrite parent asteroids. Modal abundances and mineral compositions measured in this study indicate that progressive oxidation of the ordinary chondrites likely occurred during metamorphism. Results also suggest that plagioclase crystallizes early in the metamorphic sequence, indicating that peak temperatures derived using the two-pyroxene geothermometer are more accurate than those calculated using the plagioclase geothermometer.
I also utilize ordinary chondrite modal abundances to develop new calibrations for deriving mineralogy from meteorite and asteroid spectra. Most previous studies examining the mineralogical characteristics of VISNIR asteroid spectra have focused on olivine and pyroxene proportions in single-pyroxene mixtures; therefore, current calibrations for deriving composition mineral abundances may be poorly suited for asteroids containing more than one pyroxene. It is important that calibrations are correct, because mineral abundances derived from visible/near-infrared (VISNIR) spectra are used to classify asteroids, identify meteorite parent bodies, and understand the structure of the asteroid belt. Mineral abundances derived using my calibrations correlate well with measured data for all ordinary chondrites groups, and also appear to be valid for other meteorites and asteroids with mineral abundances and chemistries similar to those of the ordinary chondrites.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Heuristic Procedures to Solve Sequencing and Scheduling Problems in Automobile Industry</dc:title>
<dc:creator>He, Jingxu</dc:creator>
<dc:description>With the growing trend for greater product variety, mixed-model assembly nowadays is commonly employed in many industries, which can enable just-in-time production for a production system with high variety. Efficient production scheduling and sequencing is important to achieve the overall material supply, production, and distribution efficiency around the mixed-model assembly line. This research addresses production scheduling and sequencing on a mixed-model assembly line for products with multiple product options, considering multiple objectives with regard to material supply, manufacturing, and product distribution. This research also addresses plant assignment for a product with multiple product options as a prior step to scheduling and sequencing for a mixed-model assembly line. This dissertation is organized into three parts based on three papers.
Introduction and literature review
Part 1. In an automobile assembly plant many product options often need to be considered in sequencing an assembly line with which multiple objectives often need to be considered. A general heuristic procedure is developed for sequencing automobile assembly lines considering multiple options. The procedure uses the construction, swapping, and re-sequencing steps, and a limited search for sequencing automobile assembly lines considering multiple options.
Part 2. In a supply chain, production scheduling and finished goods distribution have been increasingly considered in an integrated manner to achieve an overall best efficiency. This research presents a heuristic procedure to achieve an integrated consideration of production scheduling and product distribution with production smoothing for the automobile just-in-time production assembly line. A meta-heuristic procedure is also developed for improving the heuristic solution.
Part 3. For a product that can be manufactured in multiple facilities, assigning orders to the facility is a common problem faced by industry considering production, material constraints, and other supply-chain related constraints. This paper addresses products with multiple product options for plant assignment with regard to multiple constraints at individual plants in order to minimize transportation costs and costs of assignment infeasibility. A series of binary- and mixed-integer programming models are presented, and a decision support tool based on optimization models is presented with a case study.

			<dc:title>Shattered Communities:  Soldiers, Rabbis, and the Ostjuden under  German Occupation: 1915-1918</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Norrell, Tracey Hayes</dc:creator>
<dc:description>“Shattered Communities: Soldiers, Rabbis, and the Ostjuden during Occupation: 1915-1918&quot; addresses the interethnic experience in Poland during the German occupation of 1915-1918. This dissertation demonstrates that the German design for  'modernization' of the East began with the First World War, which envisioned the Jews as a critically vital component, rather than an obstacle to their success. The German military made its connection to the peoples in the East via its own army rabbis and Jewish administrators. This work examines the role of the German Army rabbis, in 1915, in establishing a Jewish press and Jewish schools, along with Jewish relief agencies funded by German Jewish businessmen, in assisting the local Ostjuden communities. By the time the guns stopped firing in 1918, however, the German government had reneged on their promises of recognition and help, and the circumstances of many Ostjuden were as precarious as they had been before the war. Even worse, the experience of war in the East encouraged the rise of racist nationalism in Germany and Eastern Europe. The roots of Nazi policies toward Jews were planted firmly in Poland and Lithuania between 1915 and 1918. But for defeat in the war, it is highly unlikely that the Nazis would ever have risen to power, and in the absence of the German experience of war in the East, the later commitment to a Jewish genocide might never have been imagined. By examining the transnational relationship between the Germans and the Polish Jewish communities during the Great War, I contribute to a better understanding of the complexities leading to the crucial fracture that took place under the pressure of total war in 1917.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Decoding Charlotte's Prevalence. A Kristevian Approach to the Representation of Femininity in Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Die Wahlverwandtschaften</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Rothne Zadori, Zsuzsanna</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This dissertation examines Goethe’s portrayal of femininity in Die Wahlver-wandtschaften and how his depiction of all three central female characters relates to feminine ideals that were promoted through the theoretical gender debate of the late 1700s in Germany and Western Europe. I analyze Charlotte’s, Luciane’s, and Ottilie’s actions and interactions in various triadic character constellations in order to offer new insights into Goethe’s portrayal of femininity. In so doing, I argue that Goethe’s depiction of Charlotte holds the key to understanding how far Die Wahlverwandtschaften functions as (critical) commentary on the late Enlightenment gender discourse.
I maintain that the actions and interactions of these three women show them as at times ‘unfit’ and/or unwilling to meet feminine ideals promoted in the late Enlightenment. I apply central concepts of Julia Kristeva’s psychoanalytic theory from the 1970s and 1980s as analytical tools to examine how far Goethe’s Wahlverwandt-schaften can be viewed as a critique of the norms and expectations commonly expressed in the late Enlightenment.
I primarily focus on Kristeva’s concepts of subjectivity formation, semiotic and symbolic modalities, abjection, and her theorizing of motherhood. Kristeva’s emphasis on the pivotal role of the maternal function in the child’s identity formation and her representation of femininity as alterity allow me to explore the significance of Charlotte’s prevalence among the characters and to approach Goethe’s ambiguous and complex portrayal of unsteady, constantly shifting, and interrelated models of femininity in Charlotte, Luciane, and Ottilie as a narrative experiment in which he tests the viability of such models within the surrounding social discourse.
In the main body of this dissertation, I begin by concentrating on Charlotte’s partnerships with men, and then I focus on her maternal role in relation to Luciane, Ottilie, and Otto. By making Charlotte the ‘epicenter’ of this investigation, I explore how far Goethe shapes her, Luciane, and Ottilie as characters who transgress late Enlightenment gender boundaries and thus deviate from what were considered ‘feminine ideals’ in order to underscore the arbitrary and contradictory nature of the prevalent social order.</dc:description>

The central goal of elementary reading instruction is to teach students to make sense of the range of texts that they encounter during their school careers and lives. The issue of interest in this study is to better understand educational practice for upper elementary reading comprehension instruction.  Using a case study design within the framework of symbolic interactionism, I studied four upper elementary teachers and examined the nature of their experiences with organizing, carrying out, and learning about reading comprehension instruction.  Three weeks of classroom observations of each teachers’ language arts instruction and three interviews of each teacher constitute the major sources of data for this study.
Results suggest that each teacher provided her students a different type of instructional experience around reading comprehension, despite having access to same kinds of instructional materials and assessment information.  The instructional experiences offered by the teachers were contingent upon the teachers’ perspectives on the construct of reading comprehension and the factors that weighed most heavily in their individual decision-making processes about reading comprehension instruction.  Several additional patterns emerged across the teachers.  All four teachers made adaptations to their core reading program, utilized a small, consistent set of instructional routines in day-to-day instruction, and identified working with struggling students as an area of concern with which they felt unprepared to handle well.  None of the teachers were observed or reported consistently employing direct, explicit, accountable ways of talking with students about texts or about ways of thinking through texts.
These findings suggest future research and professional development efforts to improve reading comprehension instruction should begin with the ways in which teachers think about reading comprehension and the kinds of decisions teachers make as a result of their working definitions.  In addition, more attention needs to be paid to supporting teachers in making thoughtful adaptations to their curriculum materials, in expanding the range of instructional routines employed on a regular basis, and in learning how to meet the needs of students struggling with comprehension.  Finally, greater emphasis needs to be placed on fostering the kinds of talk amongst teachers and students that leads to the most robust reading comprehension development.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Transcription Analysis of &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; O157:H7 Exposed to Sodium Benzoate</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Critzer, Faith</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Advances in microbial genetics have allowed discovery and assignment of function for many genes. High-throughput transcription analysis can be conducted for foodborne pathogens to give insight into mechanisms of adaptation and survival in adverse conditions. With heightened knowledge of gene expression in these conditions, steps can be taken to counteract adaptive mechanisms and inhibit growth or survival of foodborne pathogens.
Sodium benzoate is a food antimicrobial that is commonly used in beverages and fruit juices. A study was conducted to determine the gene expression of Escherichia coli O157:H7 when exposed to sodium benzoate.
First, a qualitative study to determine transcription of marA, stx1, and eaeA was undertaken using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-RT-PCR). Expression of the mar operon causes increased antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens. Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1) is a well described verotoxin produced by enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), and EaeA, or intimin, helps establish E. coli O157:H7 in the intestinal tract. For marA and stx1, rt-RT-PCR products were detected at a 1-log greater dilution in sodium benzoate treated cells, indicating a greater level of transcription in these cells.
Next, a microarray study was conducted to determine transcription of E. coli O157:H7 when exposed to 0.5% sodium benzoate. Results indicate that the phosphate specific transport (Pst) system was rapidly (within 5 min) up-regulated in response to sodium benzoate. This system is essential for supplying phosphate used in synthesizing compounds such as ATP, phospholipids, and proteins. Research with Mycobacterium smegmatis also shows that this system can serve as an efflux pump.
The urease operon was also shown to be up-regulated in E. coli O157:H7 after 60 min of exposure to sodium benzoate. Urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide, and is one mechanism by which microorganisms survive in acidic environments. In this study, exposure of E. coli O157:H7 to sodium benzoate at neutral pH showed increase in transcription of the entire urease operon.
These data indicate that stx1 and marA genes as well as the Pst system and urease operon could play a role in pathogen virulence and survival when treated with sodium benzoate.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>&lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; Pathogenesis and Subunit Vaccine Development</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Zeng, Ximin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Campylobacter jejuni is the leading bacterial cause of human gastroenteritis in the United States. Increasing resistance of Campylobacter to clinical antibiotics raises an urgent need for novel strategies to prevent and control infections in humans and animal reservoirs, which necessitates a better understanding of Campylobacter pathogenesis. We hypothesize that multidrug efflux pump CmeABC and ferric enterobactin (FeEnt) iron acquisition systems, which play a critical role in Campylobacter pathogenesis, are novel targets for developing effective measures against Campylobacter. To test this, the molecular, antigenic, functional, and protective characteristics of two outer membrane proteins, CmeC (an essential component of CmeABC drug efflux pump) and CfrA (a FeEnt receptor), were examined. Both CmeC and CfrA are highly conserved and widely produced in C. jejuni strains. Anti-CmeC and Anti-CfrA antibodies inhibited the function of CmeABC efflux pump and CfrA, resulting enhanced susceptibility to bile salts and reduced utilization of FeEnt of C. jejuni, respectively. Immunoblotting analysis also indicated that CfrA is expressed and immunogenic in vivo. Amino acid substitution mutagenesis demonstrated that a highly conserved basic amino acid R327 in CfrA plays a critical role in FeEnt acquisition. The purified recombinant CmeC and a Salmonella live vaccine expressing the protective epitope of CfrA were evaluated as subunit vaccines against Campylobacter infection in the chicken model. CmeC vaccination elicited immune response but failed to reduce C. jejuni colonization in the intestine.  However, Salmonella-vectored vaccine conferred significant protection against C. jejuni challenge. To further elucidate the role of iron acquisition in the pathogenesis of Campylobacter, whole genome sequence of a unique C. jejuni strain was determined using a 454 GS FLX sequencer with Titanium series reagents. Comparative genomics analysis led to the identification of a novel Campylobacter Enterobactin Esterase (Cee) that is essential in the CfrB-dependent FeEnt utilization pathway. Extensive genetic manipulation revealed molecular pathways and mechanistic features of the two orchestrated FeEnt acquisition systems in Campylobacter. This project provides critical information about the feasibility of targeting CmeC and CfrA for immune protection against Campylobacter colonization in the intestine, and increases our understanding of the critical role of FeEnt acquisition in the pathophysiology of Campylobacter.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Biogeography and Genetic Diversity of Toxin Producing Cyanobacteria in a Laurentian Great Lake</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Rinta-Kanto, Johanna Maaria</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The North American Great Lakes are a vital source on a global scale, as they hold ~18 % of the potable water resources on our planet. Cyanobacteria of the genus Microcystis are commonly found in fresh water environments around the world, and since the mid-1990s also in Lake Erie. The reasons for the success for these potentially toxic cyanobacteria in Lake Erie are not completely understood. In this study we have applied modern molecular tools to analyze field samples to provide an insight into the genotypic composition and diversity of the Microcystis community in the past and present day Lake Erie. We have also analyzed a three-year data set to identify specific environmental factors that contribute to the abundance of Microcystis genotypes and microcystin production. In addition, in a laboratory-based study we examined the effect of nutrients on transcriptional activity of the microcystin synthetase gene mcyD.
The results of this study suggest that, although toxic Microcystis form &lt; 10 % of the total cyanobacterial population in Lake Erie, the toxin-producing Microcystis community in Lake Erie is diverse, and that these populations are stabile on a time scale of decades. Sediments acting as a reservoir of Microcystis are likely contributing to the persistence of the population. Although Microcystis is the dominant microcystin producer in the lake, other microcystin-producing cyanobacteria were also found in spatially isolated regions of the lake. While microcystin concentration in Lake Erie is correlated positively with total phosphorus (P&lt;0.001) and surface reactive phosphorus (P&lt;0.001), and negatively with the molar ratio total nitrogen to total phosphorus (P&lt;0.001); toxic Microcystis abundance correlates negatively with NO3 concentration (P=0.04) and positively with surface water temperatures (ranging from 20.8 °C to 27.4 °C) (P=0.03). These observations, along with findings from culture based experiments, suggest decoupling of the factors governing proliferation of toxic cells and toxin production. Culture based experiments also suggested that the chemical form of phosphorus may be an important factor in regulating microcystin biosynthesis in Microcystis based on monitoring relative transcriptional activity of the mcyD gene. The transcriptional activity of mcyD was higher (P=0.118) in cells grown in BG11-medium containing 2.3 μM organic phosphorus (glycerol 2-phosphate disodium salt hydrate) than in cells grown in BG11-medium containing 2.3 μM inorganic phosphorus (K2HPO4).</dc:description>

			<dc:title>DC Distribution with Fuel Cells as Distributed Energy Resources</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Starke, Michael</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In recent years, the idea of a direct current (DC) distribution systems has returned to the public eye as a result of DC based energy sources. The battle between alternating current (AC) and DC began with Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse long ago with AC becoming the victor as a result of the transformer. However, development of power electronics and switching devices and DC based energy sources such as fuel cells has forced the reevaluation of DC systems. This dissertation is focused on once again addressing this topic, but with an examination of the technologies as they stand today.  Along with examining basic efficiency of the competing technologies, distributed generation has as well peaked the interest and will be incorporated into the analysis. Optimum placement of this distributed generation (DG) source is vital to obtain the maximum benefit and techniques for optimization are examined.  The sensitivity and “rules of thumb” for placement of DG in a DC system are developed. Last, the largest driving factor for system changes is cost. A brief examination of the economic factors that have the potential to drive DC systems is examined.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Optimization of Interfacial Interactions to Achieve the Nanoscale Dispersion of Clay in Polymer/Clay Nanocomposites</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kumar, Deepali</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Polymer clay nanocomposites are a promising class of multicomponent systems where incorporation of small amount of clay results in dramatic improvement of mechanical, thermal and barrier properties. However, accomplishment of these properties necessitates molecular level dispersion of the clay platelets in the polymer matrix. This thesis presents the guidelines for obtaining thermodynamically stable nanocomposites where strong specific interactions such as hydrogen bonding between the polymer and the clay can be utilized to achieve the desired goal of nanoscale dispersion of clay sheets.
In first part of the dissertation, optimization of intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the polymer and clay is carried out by controlling the distribution of hydroxyl groups on the copolymer of styrene and 4-vinyl phenol. Copolymers ranging from 0- 100% vinyl phenol are synthesized by free radical polymerization. Nanocomposites containing 50 % poly(vinyl phenol) and 40 % poly(vinyl phenol) show optimum dispersion due to large extent of intermolecular hydrogen bonding with drastic improvement in glass transition temperature.
Furthermore, the effect of the nature of clay surfactant on the dispersion of clay sheets in the polymer matrix is also studied. Nanomer I.24 TL and Cloisite 25A show similar trends in dispersion for all the copolymer compositions. Increase in vinyl phenol content from 0-50% enhances the dispersion of clay platelets. However, Nanomer I.24 TL and Cloisite 25A show different morphological behavior than Cloisite Na+ towards the polymer containing 100% vinyl phenol. This behavior arises due to the fact that hydrophobic surfactants of Nanomer I.24 TL and Cloisite 25A do not find themselves very compatible with hydrophilic polymer, poly(vinyl phenol) thus giving rise to intercalated morphology in opposition to exfoliation observed for Cloisite Na+ nanocomposite with the same polymer. Cloisite Na+ is highly hydrophilic and therefore very miscible with 100% vinyl phenol, consequently a nanocomposite with improved dispersion is obtained.
Next, clay loading is also optimized in the nanocomposites to obtain the best morphological and thermal improvements. Clay loadings of 1, 3, 5 and 8 wt % are mixed with copolymers ranging from 0-100 % vinyl phenol. 3 and 5 % clay loadings with PVPh40 and PVPh50 nanocomposites exhibit optimum dispersion of clay platelets with drastic improvement in glass transition temperature.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>University Alcohol Prevention, Public Relations and Organizational Legitimacy from the Parental Perspective</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Brummette III, John E.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Developed from the public relations process model, the purpose of this study was to identify parental perceptions of university drinking norms and their relationship with parental perceptions of the organizational legitimacy of the university. This study used a web-based survey to assess an N = 173 parents of current university students at the University of Tennessee – Knoxville. The results of this study identified that parents have exaggerated misperceptions of college drinking that are related to their overall perceptions of the university in terms of organizational legitimacy. The study also found that parental awareness of university prevention efforts were strongly correlated with parental perceptions of organizational legitimacy. This study advocates the importance for universities to approach alcohol prevention from an issues management perspective that includes the use of two-way symmetrical communication with parents as well as the possible benefits of using social marketing as a public relations tool.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Juvenile Competence to Stand Trial: An Examination of the Effects of Cognitive Ability, Psychiatric Symptomatology, and Psychosocial Maturity</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kivisto, Aaron John</dc:creator>
<dc:description>As the courts have evolved over the past 30 years towards increasingly punitive sanctions for youthful offenders, the fundamental protections afforded to adult defendants have become increasingly relevant for youthful offenders. Among these protections, the right of juveniles to be competent to stand trial has gained nearly universal recognition throughout this country’s courts. Congruent with theory and previous research, we hypothesized that age, intellectual ability, psychiatric symptomatology, and maturity would all be directly related to adolescents’ competence. It was also anticipated that adolescents in the detention sample would evidence lower maturity and competency-related abilities compared to the community sample. Expanding on previous research that has consistently documented an association between age and competence, we hypothesized that psychosocial maturity would partially mediate this relationship. Further, we hypothesized that psychosocial maturity would moderate the direct relations between intellectual ability, psychiatric symptomatology, and competence.   In order to test these hypotheses, we utilized a secondary sample from the MacArthur Adjudicative Competence Study that included 927 male and female adolescents ages 11- to 17-years-old recruited from 11 juvenile detention facilities and their surrounding communities. Results demonstrated that age, intellectual ability, and maturity were each directly positively related to competence, and psychiatric symptomatology was negatively related to competence. Further, results provided some support for the hypothesis that maturity partially explains the relationship between age and competence. While the relationship between psychiatric symptomatology and competence did not vary across high and low levels of maturity, results supported the hypothesis that the relationship between intellectual ability and competence varies across high and low levels of psychosocial maturity.    Findings suggest that intellectual ability plays an essential role in juveniles’ adjudicative competence and can serve as a protective factor against some aspects of immaturity. Given these findings, it is suggested that youth with deficient intellectual abilities facing the possibility of transfer be automatically referred for evaluations of adjudicative competence. Further, findings suggest that maturity appears to warrant further attention from researchers and clinicians involved in evaluating juveniles’ adjudicative competence. Results are discussed in terms of the legal and clinical implications of developmental immaturity on the prosecution of youthful offenders.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Two-Step Variations for Processes Driven by Fractional Brownian Motion With Application in Testing for Jumps From the High Frequency Data</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Si, Shiying</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this dissertation we introduce the realized two-step variation of stochastic processes and develop its asymptotic theory for processes based on fractional Brownian motion and on more general Gaussian processes with stationary increments. The realized two-step variation is analogous to the realized 1, 1-order bipower variation introduced by Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard [8] but mathematically is simpler to deal with. The powerful techniques of Wiener/Itˆo/Malliavin calculus for establishing limit laws play a key rule in our proofs. We include some stochastic simulations as an illustration of our theory. As a result of our study, we provide test statistics for testing for jumps in high frequency data and establish their consistency and asymptotic normality under the null hypothesis that there are no jumps. Testing for jumps from high frequency data has important applications in Financial Mathematics.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Systematics of &lt;em&gt;Gratiola&lt;/em&gt; (Plantaginaceae)</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Estes, Larry D.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Gratiola (Plantaginaceae tribe Gratioleae) is a genus of ca. 33 wetland-adapted herbaceous species found mostly in temperate or tropical-montane regions of the Americas, Eurasia, and Australasia. The only worldwide taxonomic treatment of Gratiola was published more than 160 years ago and only a few representatives of the genus have been included in published molecular phylogenetic studies. The overall aim of this investigation was to provide a modern systematic study of Gratiola by determining the phylogenetic placement of Gratiola within the Gratioleae using chloroplast DNA sequence data (Chapter 2); examining the phylogenetic relationships, morphological character evolution, and biogeographical patterns within Gratiola using a combination of chloroplast DNA sequence data and morphology (Chapter 3); and conducting a taxonomic study of the Gratiola neglecta species complex, a group of four closely related and predominantly eastern North American species (Chapter 4). This dissertation is the accumulation of information from three original research papers. The first paper (Chapter 2) has been accepted for publication in Systematic Botany. The second paper (Chapter 3) will be submitted to Systematic Botany. The third paper (Chapter 4) has been published in the Journal of the Botanical Research Institute of Texas. The results from this study show (1) that Gratiola sensu lato (including Amphianthus, Fonkia, Sophronanthe, and Tragiola) is monophyletic and firmly embedded in a monophyletic Gratioleae and is sister to the Old World genera Hydrotriche and Limnophila; (2) that the 33 species (including four undescribed taxa) of Gratiola group into four major clades (Diandrae, Gratiola, Nibora, Sophronanthe) that are each morphologically cohesive and largely correspond to major biogeographic regions; and (3) that the Gratiola neglecta Complex includes four species (G. neglecta, G. floridana, G. graniticola, and G. quartermaniae), two of which constitute previously undescribed species that are morphologically and ecologically distinct.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Evaluating Frame-of-Reference Rater Training Effectiveness via Performance Schema Accuracy</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Gorman, Charles A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Frame-of-reference (FOR) training has been shown to be an effective intervention for improving the accuracy of performance ratings (e.g., Woehr &amp; Huffcutt, 1994). Despite evidence in support of the effectiveness of FOR training, few studies have empirically addressed the ultimate goal of FOR training, which is to train raters to share a common conceptualization of performance (Athey &amp; McIntyre, 1987; Woehr, 1994). The present study tested the hypothesis that FOR-trained raters would possess schemas of performance after training that are more similar to an expert schema than would control-trained raters. It was also hypothesized that schema accuracy would be positively related to rating accuracy. Results supported these hypotheses. Implications for FOR training research and practice are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Role of Financial Services Advertising on Investors' Decision-Making</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lee, Tae Jun</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The present study assesses the effect of financial services advertising on investors’ decision-making by adopting a two-sided approach: a stimulus-side analysis to document the nature and prevalence of advertising strategies and advertising disclosures being used and a response-side investigation to examine the investors’ processing of and receptiveness to financial services advertising.  By performing a content analysis of recently published financial services magazine advertisements, this study provides a contemporary look at whether and how financial services companies inform, persuade, and communicate with average investors.  Results from this content analysis method is also used as a foundation to help design realistic test ads in the subsequent experimental design as a response-side approach.  Combined with stimulus-side data, a between-group experimental design allows an empirical test of how the interaction between investors’ exposures to different advertising practices (i.e., advertising strategies and advertising disclosures) and individual regulatory focus might affect the ways investors perceive and evaluate the advertised financial product.  In this stage, the likely processing and persuasive differences between advertising strategies and advertising disclosures and the potential moderating role of investors’ regulatory focus form the basis of the response-side approach to complement the content analysis phase.  Results from the content analysis show that financial services companies increased informational advertising strategies and presented more advertising information during the three-year (2007-2009) period of interest.  Findings indicate that financial services companies might play a role in enhancing the role of communication, information, and advertising in the marketplace for financial literacy.  However, in order to adequately evaluate the range of investor’s response to advertising strategies and advertising disclosures, this study employs a two advertising strategies (information versus transformational) x two advertising disclosures (complete disclosure versus non-disclosure) x two regulatory focus (promotion-focused versus prevention-focused) between-subject, randomized, experimental design.  Findings from the experimental design reveal that investors’ financial decision-making may be affected by internal characteristics (i.e., regulatory focus) as well as external information (i.e., advertising strategies and advertising disclosures).  Especially, regulatory focus was found to be function as a moderating variable that can influence the direction and strength of relationship between different financial services advertising practices and the outcome variables of financial decision-making such as risk perceptions, product attitudes, and purchase intentions.  Finally, theoretical, managerial, and policy implications are discussed and opportunities for the future research are identified.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this dissertation, we develop novel computationally effiient model subset selection methods for multiple and multivariate linear regression models which are both robust and misspecification resistant.  Our approach is to use a three-way hybrid method which employs the information theoretic measure of complexity (ICOMP) computed on robust M-estimators as model subset selection criteria, integrated with genetic algorithms (GA) as the subset model searching engine.
Despite the rich literature on the robust estimation techniques, bridging the theoretical and applied aspects related to robust model subset selection has been somewhat neglected.  A few information criteria in the multiple regression literature are robust.  However, none of them is model misspecification resistant and none of them could be generalized to the misspecified multivariate regression.  In this dissertation, we introduce for the first time both robust and misspecification resistant information complexity (ICOMP) criterion to fill in the gap in the literature.
More specifically in multiple linear regression, we introduce robust M-estimators with misspecification resistant ICOMP and use the new information criterion as the fitness fuction in GA to carry out the model subset selection.  For multivariate linear regression, we derive the two-stage robust Mahalanobis distance (RMD) estimator and introduce this RMD estimator in the computation of information criteria.  The new information criteria are used as the fitness function in the GA to perform the model subset selection.
Comparative studies on the simulated data for both multiple and multivariate regression show that the robust and misspecification resistant ICOMP outperforms the other robust information criteria and the non-robust ICOMP computed using OLS (or MLE) when the data contain outliers and error terms in the model deviate from a normal distribution.  Compared with the all possible model subset selection, GA combined with the robust and misspecification resistant infromation criteria is proved to be an effective method which can quickly find the a near subset, if not the best, without having to search the whole subset model space.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Intrinsically Evolvable Artificial Neural Networks</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Merchant, Saumil Girish</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Dedicated hardware implementations of neural networks promise to provide faster, lower power operation when compared to software implementations executing on processors. Unfortunately, most custom hardware implementations do not support intrinsic training of these networks on-chip. The training is typically done using offline software simulations and the obtained network is synthesized and targeted to the hardware offline. The FPGA design presented here facilitates on-chip intrinsic training of artificial neural networks. Block-based neural networks (BbNN), the type of artificial neural networks implemented here, are grid-based networks neuron blocks. These networks are trained using genetic algorithms to simultaneously optimize the network structure and the internal synaptic parameters. The design supports online structure and parameter updates, and is an intrinsically evolvable BbNN platform supporting functional-level hardware evolution. Functional-level evolvable hardware (EHW) uses evolutionary algorithms to evolve interconnections and internal parameters of functional modules in reconfigurable computing systems such as FPGAs. Functional modules can be any hardware modules such as multipliers, adders, and trigonometric functions. In the implementation presented, the functional module is a neuron block. The designed platform is suitable for applications in dynamic environments, and can be adapted and retrained online. The online training capability has been demonstrated using a case study. A performance characterization model for RC implementations of BbNNs has also been presented.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Feature-based Image Comparison and Its Application in Wireless Visual Sensor Networks</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bai, Yang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This dissertation studies the feature-based image comparison method and its application in Wireless Visual Sensor Networks.
Wireless Visual Sensor Networks (WVSNs), formed by a large number of low-cost, small-size visual sensor nodes, represent a new trend in surveillance and monitoring practices. Although each single sensor has very limited capability in sensing, processing and transmission, by working together they can achieve various high level tasks. Sensor collaboration is essential to WVSNs and normally performed among sensors having similar measurements, which are called neighbor sensors. The directional sensing characteristics of imagers and the presence of visual occlusion present unique challenges to neighborhood formation, as geographically-close neighbors might not monitor similar scenes. Besides, the energy resource on the WVSNs is also very tight, with wireless communication and complicated computation consuming most energy in WVSNs. Therefore the feature-based image comparison method has been proposed, which directly compares the captured image from each visual sensor in an economical way in terms of both the computational cost and the transmission overhead.
The feature-based image comparison method compares different images and aims to find similar image pairs using a set of local features from each image. The image feature is a numerical representation of the raw image and can be more compact in terms of the data volume than the raw image. The feature-based image comparison contains three steps: feature detection, descriptor calculation and feature comparison.
For the step of feature detection, the dissertation proposes two computationally efficient corner detectors. The first detector is based on the Discrete Wavelet Transform that provides multi-scale corner point detection and the scale selection is achieved efficiently through a Gaussian convolution approach. The second detector is based on a linear unmixing model, which treats a corner point as the intersection of two or three “line” bases in a 3 by 3 region. The line bases are extracted through a constrained Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) approach and the corner detection is accomplished through counting the number of contributing bases in the linear mixture.
For the step of descriptor calculation, the dissertation proposes an effective dimensionality reduction algorithm for the high dimensional Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) descriptors. A set of 40 SIFT descriptor bases are extracted through constrained NMF from a large training set and all SIFT descriptors are then projected onto the space spanned by these bases, achieving dimensionality reduction.
The efficiency of the proposed corner detectors have been proven through theoretical analysis. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed corner detectors and the dimensionality reduction approach has been validated through extensive comparison with several state-of-the-art feature detector/descriptor combinations.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Adolescent Female Substance Use: An Examination of Male Peer Influences and Parental Control</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Whiteford, Sarah Gwynne</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Central to many theories of deviance and delinquency (differential association, social learning, and social bond) are peer and familial influences on deviant behavior.  A conceptual framework that incorporated both peer and familial influence to address the role of cross-sex peers on female deviance was built based on a review of the literature.  Using substance use as an indicator of deviance, the effects of having three forms of male associates (male friends, romantic partners, and sexual partners) on female substance use were examined. Focus was on the effects of different types of male peer relationships, how those effects differed from the effects of female peer relationships, and how parental control might be greater for girls with only female peers.
The conceptual model incorporated three measures of parental control—parentally granted autonomy, parental presence at home, and time spent in shared activities with parents—that were used to test the effects of male associates on female substance use.  Analyzing data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), one combined measure for male associates was regressed on female substance use while controlling for parental control measures to determine if the effects of male associates on female substance use were mediated by parental control.
Results indicated that while each type of male associate increased the likelihood of female substance use, effects were stronger for romantic and sexual partners than for male friends.  Female friends also increased the likelihood of substance use.  While the effects of male friends did not significantly differ from the effects of female friends, the effects of romantic and sexual partners did.  The effects of male associates were significant even with the inclusion of parental control measures.  Though both relationships with male associates and parents significantly affected female substance use, results did not provide support for the conceptual model.  With results providing greater support for theories of peer influence than parental influence, future research should continue to examine peer relationship influences on deviance, how these influences vary by type of association, and how gender effects peer influence processes.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Algorithms for Multi-Sample Cluster Analysis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Almutairi, Fahad</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this study, we develop algorithms to solve the Multi-Sample Cluster Analysis (MSCA) problem. This problem arises when we have multiple samples and we need to find the statistical model that best fits the cluster structure of these samples. One important area among others in which our algorithms can be used is international market segmentation. In this area, samples about customers’preferences and characteristics are collected from di¤erent regions in the market. The goal in this case is to join the regions with similar customers’characteristics in clusters (segments).
We develop branch and bound algorithms and a genetic algorithm. In these algorithms, any of the available information criteria (AIC, CAIC, SBC, and ICOMP) can be used as the objective function to be optimized. Our algorithms use the Clique Partitioning Problem (CPP) formulation. They are the first algorithms to use information criteria with the CPP formulation.
When the branch and bound algorithms are allowed to run to completion, they converge to the optimal MSCA alternative. These methods also proved to find good solutions when they were stopped short of convergence. In particular, we develop a branching strategy which uses a &quot;look-ahead&quot; technique. We refer to this strategy as the complete adaptive branching strategy. This strategy makes the branch and bound algorithm quickly search for the optimal solution in multiple branches of the enumeration tree before using a depth- first branching strategy. In computational tests, this method’s performance was superior to other branching methods as well as to the genetic algorithm.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Total Synthesis of an Analog of Hydramycin and Derivatization of Thiol-terminated Carbohydrates and Development of a Glycoconjugate Too Set for the Assembly and Presentation of Carbohydrate Ligands on Surfaces</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bahta, Medhanit Woldeghiorghis</dc:creator>
<dc:description>2-(1,2-Dihydroxy-1-(oxiran-2-yl)ethyl)-11-hydroxy-5-methyl-1Hnaphtho[ 2,3-h]chromene-4,7,12-trione (1), a pyranoanthraquinone isolated from Streptomyces violaceus P950-4, showed a potent antibacterial and cytotoxic activity. A model synthesis for analogs 2-(1,2-dihydroxy-1-(oxiran-2-yl)ethyl)-4H-chromen- 4-one (2) and2-(1-hydroxy-1-(oxiran-2-yl)ethyl)-1H-naphtho[2,3- h]chromene-4,7,12-trione (3) was developed by Dr. David White and Dr. Sarah Headrick. A new analog, 2-(1,2-dihydroxy-1-(oxiran-2-yl)ethyl)-1H-naphtho[2,3- h]chromene-4,7,12-trione (4), was designed to be structurally more similar to hydramycin with –CH2OH functionality on the pyranone ring and anthraquinone skeleton. Therefore, it is expected to have greater anticancer activity than either analogs 2 or 3. This dissertation will cover developments, challenges and solutions in the total synthesis of the analog 4.
Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cell surfaces present a complex set of glycoconjugates. Glycoconjugates contain carbohydrates covalently linked to another building block of nature, such as an amino acid (peptide) or a lipid. Since most glycans, which are complex arrays of covalently attached sugar chains, are on the outer surface of cellular and secreted macromolecules, they are in a position to modulate or mediate a wide variety of events in cell–cell, cell–matrix, cell–surface, cell–virus and cell–molecule interactions. These interactions mediate cell adhesion, cell motility, and cell–cell communication and recognition of toxins. This dissertation is focused on the development of a glycoconjugate“tool set”, that will facilitate a modular approach to glycoarrays. The development consists of a derivatization of thiol-terminated mannose and galactose that will mimic the glycans on the cell surfaces, creation of nano-patterned microarray surfaces for the introduction of carbohydrates, and examination of the arrays by interrogation with fluorescently labeled probes.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The small Indian mongoose (Herpestes auropunctatus) on Adriatic Islands:  impact, evolution, and control</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Barun, Arijana</dc:creator>
<dc:description>ABSTRACT
One cause of declines and extinctions of island species is carnivore introduction. Four carnivores, including the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes auropunctatus), are on the IUCN’s list of 100 of the World's Worst Invasive Alien Species. My thesis summarizes global patterns of carnivore introductions and examines ecological, evolutionary, and management impacts of this mongoose. I study abundances of reptiles and amphibians on mongoose-infested and mongoose-free islands in the Adriatic Sea to determine if factors other than mongoose presence can account for abundance differences.  For several reptiles and amphibians, the mongoose is implicated as causing differences. Additionally, I assess species abundance in the small mammal community and activity times of introduced ship rats (Rattus rattus) on the same islands. The mongoose is implicated in a shift in rat activity times, but it is difficult to separate mongoose impacts on small mammal abundance from rat impacts.
To manage introduced carnivores, we can exclude, control, or eradicate them. I review literature data on mongoose eradication and control campaigns. I compiled a list of all islands with known mongoose populations and focused on assessing successes, failures, and challenges. The mongoose has been eradicated only on six very small islands.  Management at low levels by various techniques has been attempted on many islands, with variable success.
On almost all islands of introduction, the mongoose has no potential competitors of similar size. However, on three Adriatic islands where the mongoose was introduced, a similar-sized native carnivore, the stone marten (Martes foina), is present, while on one Adriatic island the small Indian mongoose is the sole carnivore.  To see if character displacement occurs in the mongoose when the marten is present, and vice-versa, I examined size variation in the diameter of the upper canine tooth (the prey-killing organ) and skull length in these two species on these islands.  Character displacement in both traits was evident for the mongoose but not the marten.
Lastly, I developed a simulation model to examine genetic consequences of serial introductions of the small Indian mongoose and found that the potential for population genetic data to determine introduction pathways and sequences is limited.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Peeking Out: A Textual Analysis of Heteronormative Images in Prime-Time Television</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Smith, D. Renee</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This dissertation traces lesbian portrayals on network television from the 1960s through the 1990s. A focus on episodic dramas and situation comedies reveals a concise representation of the mediated lesbian image. Building on existing research on lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender images on television, this work focuses exclusively on the lesbian image broadcast free of charge over the air during prime-time on commercial networks in the United States. Using a postmodern feminist framework, this textual analysis examines the images and texts portraying lesbian characters in episodic dramas and situation comedies. Furthermore, applying a semiotic lens to the analysis dissects the voice and actions of lesbian characters illustrating the ways production techniques and narrative scripting work together to represent a lesbian image on television.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Laser Textured Calcium Phosphate Bio-Ceramic Coatings on Ti-6Al-4V for Improved Wettability and Bone Cell Compatibility</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Paital, Sameer R</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The interaction at the surfaces of load bearing implant biomaterials with tissues and physiological fluids is an area of crucial importance to all kinds of medical technologies. To achieve the best clinical outcome and restore the function of the diseased tissue, several surface engineering strategies have been discussed by scientific community throughout the world. In the current work, we are focusing on one such technique based on laser surface engineering to achieve the appropriate surface morphology and surface chemistry. Here by using a pulsed and continuous wave laser direct melting techniques we synthesize three dimensional textured surfaces of calcium phosphate (Ca-P) based surface chemistry on Ti-6Al-4V. The influence of each processing type on the micro texture and phase evolution and thereby its associated effect on wettability, in vitro bioactivity, and in vitro biocompatibility are systematically discussed. For samples processed using the pulsed laser, it was realized that with increasing laser scan speed and laser pulse frequency there was a transition from surface textures with sharp circular grooves to surface textures with radial grooves and thereby improved hydrophilicity. For CW laser processing the results demonstrated improved hydrophilicity for the samples processed at 100 μm line spacing as compared to the samples processed at 200 μm line spacing. Owing to the importance of Si for cartilage and hard tissue repair, a preliminary effort for synthesizing Ca-P-SiO2 composite coating on Ti-6Al-4V surface were also conducted. As a future potential technique we also explored the Laser Interference Patterning (LIP) technique to achieve the textured surfaces and developed understanding on their wetting behavior. In the current work, by adjusting the laser processing parameters we were able to synthesize textured coatings with biocompatible phases. The in vitro bioactivity and in vitro vi biocompatibility of the coatings were proved by the precipitation of an apatite like phase following immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF), and increased proliferation and spreading of the MC3T3-E1 like cells. The results and understanding of the current research is encouraging in terms of looking at other bio-ceramic precursor compositions and laser process parameter window for synthesizing better textured biocompatible coatings.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Newly-Developed Nanostructured Microcantilever Arrays for Gas-phase and Liquid-phase Sensing</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Long, Zhou</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The microcantilever (MC) has become a common transducer for chemical and biological sensing in gas phase and liquid phase during recent years. MC sensors provide superior mass sensitivity by converting weak chemical and biological stimuli into high mechanical response.  Moreover, other advantages such as small size, low cost and array format have made MCs more attractive than other comparable sensors.
Selectivity in MC sensors can be enhanced by creating a differentially functionalized MC array (MCA) with responsive phases (RPs).  A well-designed array should incorporate RPs exhibiting a variety of possible interactions with the analytes, and a specific analyte should induce a distinctive response pattern demonstrated by the array.
The first major division of the dissertation research work focused on enhancing selectivity of MC sensor by creating a differentiating MCA. The MCs within the array were nanostructured in a previously developed manner. A self-designed capillary array was set up to chemically functionalize different ligands onto individual MCs in an array for metal ion sensing in liquid phase. Another array was prepared by selectively vapor depositing different organic RPs onto nanostructured MCs and applied to landfill siloxane sensing in gas phase.  Both of the arrays demonstrated response diversity to the target analytes.
The second major division of the dissertation research work focused on developing a new method to modify MC surfaces with a function nanostructure. Aluminium oxide nanoparticles (AONP) were uniformly dispersed onto MC and a roughened surface with high surface area was achieved as stable sensor platform. Alkoxysilyl compounds were then grafted onto this platform as RPs.  For demonstration, a MCA functionalized with three different alkoxysilanes was prepared for volatile organic compound sensing in gas phase. Additionally, another MCA was functionalized with anti-human immunoglobulin G and anti-biotin for bio-sensing in liquid phase.  Both of the arrays were prepared with the aforementioned capillary array setup. Selective responses of specific analytes, as well as good sensitivity, were obtained from each type of AONP MCA.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Republican, First, Last, and Always: A Biography of B. Carroll Reece</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bowers, Fashion Suzanne</dc:creator>
<dc:description>From 1920 to 1961, B. Carroll Reece served a then unprecedented thirty-five years in the United States House of Representatives. Reece grew up in the povertystricken area of eastern Tennessee, one of thirteen children. He attended college at Carson-Newman College and New York University but felt called to enlist in the army during World War I. He earned numerous commendations for his service and returned to the United States with an increased animosity towards communism. He returned to education, but an opportunity presented itself for Reece to fulfill his dream of entering politics. He ran for and won the First District seat in the House of Representatives in 1920. During his tenure, his hatred of communism and devotion to the Republican Party led him to become a central figure in the debates over the Muscle Shoals, Alabama, nitrate plants, the 1946 congressional elections, and the 1954 Special Committee to Investigate Tax-Exempt Foundations. Reece’s loyalty to Robert Taft and his conservative stance on international involvement, communism, and economics influenced the decision of the Republican Party to name him chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1946. He resigned this position after he was unable to use his influence to secure the presidential nomination for Taft, but he remained devoted to Taft and Taft’s desire to become president. After Taft’s death, Reece turned his attention more fully on the crusade to eradicate communism within the United States and its government. He led an investigation into large foundations for fostering subversion through their grants to leftist organizations and universities. Although this did coincide with his conservative ideology, Reece had begun to see the decline in power of the “Old Guard” faction of the Republican Party and strove desperately to prevent liberals from taking over the party. The investigation garnered much condemnation, and its report became widely criticized within Congress. His investigation contributed to the increasing animosity towards foundations and large concentrations of wealth that continues today. Reece maintained his position that communism posed a threat to the security of the nation and the Republican Party until his death in 1961.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Examining Race and Educational Reform in America: History, Strategies and an Ethnography</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Alenuma, Sidonia J</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This dissertation addresses the topic of educational reform in the United States, concentrating on the intersection of reform initiatives and issues of social difference and discrimination. It involves four interrelated phases. The first involves a historical survey of educational reform. The second is a tex.tual analysis of two contemporary reform measures (namely magnet schools and professional development schools). Third is a discussion of critical multiculturalism as a viable tool for critiquing both magnet school and professional development school initiatives. The fourth phase is an ethnography of a local school that operates simultaneously as a magnet school and a professional development school. Social difference and discrimination in general and more specifically social class and class discrimination and race and racism in particular forms the common thread that runs through all phases of the study.
A survey of historical educational reform initiatives designed to improve the quality of education and address social problems is presented. Some of the events leading to the creation of the common school and its goals are described in order to ear-mark the educational reform efforts that led to the formation of the present public schools in the United States of America. Race and social class issues have been perennial concerns of reformists and the historical survey highlights reform initiatives as efforts at social engineering designed to alleviate problems related to difference and discrimination. Busing, the 1960s initiative involving transporting children from predominantly white neighborhoods to predominantly black neighborhoods and vice versa was the earliest attempt at racial integration of schools and the provision of quality education to all American children. However, white resistance to busing and resulting racial tensions led to the eventual abandonment of this initiative and the emergence of more readily accepted contemporary measures such as &quot;magnet&quot; school programs.
Magnet programs are a strategy for both school improvement and desegregation and they have a distinctive program of study that is intended to attract a voluntary cross section of students from various racial groups. The second phase of the study provides a textual analysis of contemporary educational reforms such as magnet school programs as well as professional development school programs (PDSs) that focus on educational improvement through teacher training, research and collaboration between local public schools and universities. A textual analysis of the literature on the evolution, purposes and pros and cons of magnet and PDS programs is presented as well as a discussion of how they might be improved.
This leads to the third phase of the study - the use of critical multiculturalism to re-examine the pros and cons of magnet and PDS programs. Critical multiculturalism with its unique approach to issues of social difference (gender, class, social class and predominantly, race issues) makes it an ideal analytical tool for re-examining the pros and cons of magnet and PDS programs. Clearly these two contemporary initiatives engender educational improvements.  However, by utilizing the lens of critical multiculturalism, problems related to social difference and discrimination which remain understated or invisible in these programs' literature, also become apparent.
To explore the operation of these two programs in a real life situation, I undertook an ethnographic research of Downtown Elementary School (DES- a pseudonym) that simultaneously operates a PDS and a magnet school program. I spent approximately two years at DES collecting data through participant observation, interviewing and documentary information. The findings indicate that there are some advantages and disadvantages of these programs individually and the simultaneous operation of both at the same school. DES and its unique situation, highlights the pros and cons of educational reforms such as magnet schools and PDSs programs. That they are capable of leading to innovative and improved attempts at dealing with school, community and teacher, research, and teacher training issues is further underscored. For example, the DES experience illustrates that among others, these two reform initiatives (especially in the case of the PDSs) do contribute to the collaborative efforts of different groups of people that lead to the formation of pedagogical communities, the professional development of teachers and pre-serVice education as well as the advancement of research on school improvement. Additionally, when people from diverse backgrounds have to interact in educational reform initiatives such as the magnet program, there may be a conflict of interest that requires adjustments that may thwart the ideal aims of the program.
The conclusion is a contextual analysis of PDS and magnet programs as contemporary educational reform initiatives in a long history of educational reform. A critical multicultural analysis reveals that PDS and magnet school initiatives do, ironically, contribute to problems of discrimination. However, the pros outweigh the cons: they contribute to racial integration of education and do ameliorate inequity in education as a whole and they are a highly effective means of faculty development and the general improvement of educational standards. In this sense, they represent considerable advancements toward the general and historical goals of educational reform in the United States.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Study of Object Relations Among Self-Injuring and Non-Injuring College Students</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ness, Lorrie A</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this study is to investigate object relational and interpersonal functioning among self-injuring and non-injuring college students. It was hypothesized that self-injury would be associated with more pathological object relational functioning as measured by the Mutuality of Autonomy (MOA) and Social Cognition and Object Relation Scale (SCORS). Additionally, it was hypothesized that self-injurers would evidence significantly more global interpersonal distress on the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems-32 (IIP-32), as well as show elevations in four of the subscales of the IIP-32; self-sacrifice, non-assertiveness, over-accommodation, and interpersonal neediness. Lastly, a number of publications suggest that childhood abuse is a significant risk factor for later developing self-injurious behaviors. This study hypothesized that object relational functioning as measured by the SCORS and MOA would account for additional variance in self-injury even after abuse is taken into account. A survey of 413 college undergraduates indicated that approximately 18.6% of the sample had self-injured at least once, and rates of self-injury were not significantly different across gender. All 77 of the individuals with a history of self-injury and 77 randomly selected individuals with no history of self-injury were re-contacted and invited to participate in further research. In total, 44 self-injuring and 34 non-injuring individuals took part in the second phase of research. Each of the 78 participants completed the IIP-32, SCORS and the MOA. Findings indicate that individuals with a history of self-injury evidenced significantly more pathological scores on the MOA than individuals with no such history. Results only partially supported the hypothesis that self-injury would be related to significantly more pathological scores on the SCORS, with only one subscale of the SCORS being significantly related to self-injury. Participants with a history of self-injury also endorsed more interpersonal distress on the IIP-32 than did non-injuring participants. In addition, self-injurers were more likely to endorse a pattern of interpersonal functioning characterized by self-sacrifice, interpersonal neediness, non-assertiveness and overaccommodation than were individuals with no history of self-injury. Results of a hierarchical regression did not support the final hypothesis.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Boron and Titanium(IV) Halide Mediated Reactions</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Quinn, Michael Patrick</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This dissertation summarizes research efforts focused on the use of boron and transition metal halides to form new carbon-carbon and carbon-halide bonds. The boron halide mediated alkyne-aldehyde coupling reaction to generate 1,3,5-triaryl-1,5-dihalo-1,4-dienes was reinvestigated in an attempt to explain the stereochemistry observed during changing of both the mode of addition and the reaction temperature.  Either (Z,Z)-1,4-dienes or (Z,E)-1,4-dienes can be the predominant product depending on reaction conditions used. This mechanistic investigation also led to the discovery of several novel reactions.  These include the stereoselective preparation of (Z)-3-chloroallylic ethers from the reaction of alkenylboron dichlorides with aryl aldehydes in the presence of an amine; the titanium(IV) halide coupling of alkoxides and alkynes; the haloallylation of aryl aldehydes with boron trihalide using different allylmetals; and the base induced elimination of the haloallylated products to form 1,3-dienes.  The results of these studies strongly imply a cationic mechanism. The new reactions described herein can be characterized as atom-efficient, environmentally friendly, and capable of generating the desired products in good to excellent yields.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Power of a Paradoxical Persona: An Analysis of John Peel’s Radio Talk and Career at the BBC</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Winham, Richard P.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>John Peel holds a unique place in British broadcasting history. During his almost 40-year career as a DJ on the BBC’s Radio One and Radio Four, he not only introduced innovative music—including psychedelia, reggae, punk, hip hop, grunge and electronica—into the British mainstream, but championed hundreds of musicians whose work might otherwise have gone unnoticed. Using Peel as a case study, this research focuses on the role his persona played in three distinct aspects of his success: (1) his ability to attract audiences across several generations; (2) his longevity at the BBC, a bastion of conservative bureaucracy; and (3) his impact on the programming on BBC’s Radio One and on British popular music in general. Drawing on the theories of persona developed by Horton and Wohl (1956) and Goffman (1971, 1981), the study offers a rhetorical analysis of Peel’s broadcast talk to explicate the role of persona in his success.
By creating a persona based on selection, omission and emphasis of contradictory traits, Peel presented himself as an Everyman able to pull listeners onto his public platform while placing himself simultaneously in their worlds. Far from the artificial and static persona conceptualized by Horton and Wohl (1956), Peel’s on-air persona was paradoxical and flexible—traits that enhanced his credibility and help explain his unprecedented tenure as a DJ on Radio One and appeal as the host and writer for a talk program on Radio Four. The study ends with a discussion of the conditions required and extent to which it is possible for a single individual such as Peel to have a significant impact on social and cultural change.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>SB-CoRLA: Schema-Based Constructivist Robot Learning Architecture</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Tang, Yifan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This dissertation explores schema-based robot learning. I developed SB-CoRLA (Schema- Based, Constructivist Robot Learning Architecture) to address the issue of constructivist robot learning in a schema-based robot system. The SB-CoRLA architecture extends the previously developed ASyMTRe (Automated Synthesis of Multi-team member Task solutions through software Reconfiguration) architecture to enable constructivist learning for multi-robot team tasks. The schema-based ASyMTRe architecture has successfully solved the problem of automatically synthesizing task solutions based on robot capabilities. However, it does not include a learning ability. Nothing is learned from past experience; therefore, each time a new task needs to be assigned to a new team of robots, the search process for a solution starts anew. Furthermore, it is not possible for the robot to develop a new behavior.
The complete SB-CoRLA architecture includes off-line learning and online learning processes. For my dissertation, I implemented a schema chunking process within the framework of SB-CoRLA that involves off-line evolutionary learning of partial solutions (also called “chunks”), and online solution search using learned chunks. The chunks are higher level building blocks than the original schemas. They have similar interfaces to the original schemas, and can be used in an extended version of the ASyMTRe online solution searching process.
SB-CoRLA can include other learning processes such as an online learning process that uses a combination of exploration and a goal-directed feedback evaluation process to develop new behaviors by modifying and extending existing schemas. The online learning process is planned for future work.
The significance of this work is the development of an architecture that enables continuous, constructivist learning by incorporating learning capabilities in a schema-based robot system, thus allowing robot teams to re-use previous task solutions for both existing and new tasks, to build up more abstract schema chunks, as well as to develop new schemas. The schema chunking process can generate solutions in certain situations when the centralized ASyMTRe cannot find solutions in a timely manner. The chunks can be re-used for different applications, hence improving the search efficiency.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Successful veterinary practice requires a unique combination of medical competence and other professional skills that include empathy, communication skills, business and management skills. Results of two recent national studies have indicated that many veterinarians possess the medical knowledge, but not the ancillary skills, that can determine their economic success. Furthermore, growth in non-practice veterinary careers and changes in food animal production medicine have accentuated the need for veterinarians with exceptional teamwork, management and leadership skills. These nontechnical competencies pose a challenge to veterinary educators, who have traditionally focused on transfer of biomedical knowledge and have had limited involvement in these policy issues. In this study, veterinary faculty from five veterinary colleges were surveyed regarding the importance of nontechnical skills for veterinary graduates, where nontechnical skills should be taught, and their own role and level of preparation in cultivating such skills.
Faculty respondents uniformly agreed that nontechnical competencies are important for veterinary graduates and should be cultivated across the spectrum of preveterinary, veterinary and postgraduate education. The support is greatest for critical thinking and intrapersonal competencies and less for management and business competencies. Basic science, nonveterinarian and junior faculty tend to more strongly appreciate the importance of nontechnical skills. Large animal faculty and midcareer faculty exhibit a more reserved level of support.
Women faculty are more likely to support the development of nontechnical competencies across the continuum of education. Junior faculty, though supportive of the importance of such skills, are less likely than other faculty to view veterinary clinical education as a primary time for their development. Junior faculty are also less likely to perceive a personal role in the cultivation of nontechnical competencies in veterinary students. Faculty members’ view of the role and composition of preveterinary and preclinical veterinary education, and their perceptions of personal ability in the cultivation of nontechnical competencies, may be unique to an institution.
Institutional and professional leaders should tailor faculty development and curricular discussions with these disciplinary and career stage differences in mind. Educational leaders should also work toward building integrated methods of training veterinary students in business, management, coaching and leadership skills.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Study of the Development of Long-Term Marriages Lasting 25 Years or More</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Gnilka, Alexander S</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to examine the development of long-term marriages lasting 25 years or more. Six couples were interviewed using a qualitative case study methodology using the nine task model created by Wallerstein and Blakeslee (1995) as the theoretical framework. This study sought to understand how couples in long-term marriages demonstrated utilizing Wallerstein and Blakeslee’s nine tasks, and if they identified any new tasks, a hierarchy, and any changes to the definitions of the tasks. Data were collected through interviews, observations, and a survey. Multiple themes were developed for how participants utilized the nine original tasks in their long-term marriages. In addition, four new themes, (1) the ability to compromise, (2) having outside support, (3) planning for the future, and (4) having similar backgrounds are discussed. A hierarchy was developed determining that the three most important tasks were: (1) providing comfort and support; (2) keeping a sense of humor and shared interests; and (3) building togetherness, intimacy and autonomy. The two least important tasks included: (1) keeping in mind why and how you fell in love, and (2) separating from family of origin. There were changes in three definitions of the tasks including (1) separating from family of origin, (2) keeping a sense of humor and shared interests, and (3) keeping in mind how and why you originally fell in love. Findings also indicated the need for communication, time, and love to be present before any of the developmental tasks can be utilized in a long-term marriage. Recommendations are provided for future research on long-term marriage.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>&quot;This Butterfly Coming Out of Its Cocoon&quot;: A Phenomenological Investigation of Significant Weight Loss</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Medeson, Melissa N.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The current epidemic of obesity has caught the attention of the entire nation as the social, economic, and personal consequences of being overweight or obese affect everyone from politicians to insurance companies, employers to health care providers and health and medical industries across the country (National Institutes of Health, 2000). In response, the physical aspects of weight loss have been examined in great detail. However, the psychological, emotional and social factors that are an integral part of the process are often neglected. The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine the experience of significant weight loss. Utilizing the phenomenological method based on the philosophical underpinnings of Merleau-Ponty (1945/1962), 12 individual experiences of weight loss were analyzed to find descriptive themes of the weight loss experience. Individuals (23-72 years old) who had lost at least 20% of their body weight (50-200 pounds) participated in one-on-one audiorecorded interviews describing their personal experience with weight loss. Themes that emerged include: (a) Control/Freedom; (b) Changing; (c) Choosing; and (d) Size/Image. Each of these themes is grounded in Body, Self and Other (Merleau-Ponty, 1962). Individuals engaged in a continuous struggle between control (being controlled by weight) and freedom (controlling the weight and being free from it). Nearly all participants distinctly identified a conscious choice or decision to change their lives and thus through daily personal choices, external triggers, support, encouragement and setbacks along the way, the battle began. This lifestyle change was further described as a transformation, a path, a journey, and a process as physical, psychological, emotional, and social changes were discovered. Individuals described their bodies changing in physical size and image as they were personally aware of it as well as when others noticed it. Participants’ descriptions shed light on the phenomenon of weight loss which may aid researchers, teachers, health and fitness professionals, doctors and other health care providers in their treatment approaches. This research points to new possibilities for addressing the problems associated with overweight and obesity across the globe.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Social Ecology of Parenting: Systematically Modeling The Antecedents of Supportive and Intrusive Parenting</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Schluterman, Julie A</dc:creator>
<dc:description>One of the significant contributions of this study is its inclusion of the role of social contextual factors in determining parenting. I built on the ecological model proposed by Belsky (1984). As such, the parenting model tested in this dissertation included individual level determinants of parenting: 1) parent characteristics (e.g., developmental history), and 2) child characteristics (e.g., behavior problems). Yet, rather than include a social context domain as described by Belsky, I distinguished between within family context (e.g., interparental hostility) and external to family context (e.g., work-family conflict, neighborhood disorganization) as social contextual sources of stress and support to the parent-child relationship.
A second significant contribution of this study is attention to parent gender. I included assessments of both mother and father parenting and specifically test for hypothesized differences in how the predictive model might operate differently depending on the parent’s gender. It is important to note further that the accomplishment of this examination of parent gender involved the use of a methodology that is itself an important contribution to the existing work. Specifically, my methodology involves simultaneous testing of mother and father data, something that has not typically been done in past studies. Critically, this methodology controls for any overlap or similarity between mother and father parenting and thereby allows for a better test of the uniqueness of mother and father parenting and of patterns of predicting mother and father parenting.
This study employed parent reported data from the NIMH-funded Ogden Youth and Family Project, a longitudinal, sequential-cohort study of families with adolescent children (N = 933). Using structural equation modeling, we found that the model adequately fit the data while direct and indirect effects on parenting were found. The individual level parenting determinants of child behavior problems and parental depression were significantly directly associated with parenting, particularly for fathers. The within family contextual variable of covert marital conflict was directly associated with father parenting, and directly and indirectly associated with mother intrusive parenting through maternal depression. As risk factors external to the family, workfamily conflict was not significantly related to parenting, and neighborhood disorganization was indirectly related to intrusive mothering (but not her supportive parenting or to father’s parenting), through elevated levels of marital conflict and depression.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Autobiographical Memory Specificity and the Role of Defensiveness, Brooding, Executive Control, and Family Functioning</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Schlachter, Lina Carvalho</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The aim of this study was to examine the importance of defensiveness, tendency to brood, cognitive complaints and family functioning in the generation of specific autobiographical memories among a clinical sample of diagnostically diverse adult outpatients. Adults who report more defensiveness, more proneness to brood, more cognitive complaints and were raised by more dysfunctional families were hypothesized to elicit fewer specific memories. Further, trauma history and depressed mood were also explored. To explore these questions, I use data collected from eighty-eight adults. Pearson correlation is used to analyze the relationship between memory specificity and defensiveness, likelihood to brood, cognitive complaints and family functionality. Multiple regression analysis is used to explore whether the relationship between the previously mentioned variables depends on depressed mood. The results indicate:(1) patients who are more defensive have fewer specific memories, (2) the relationship between proneness to brood and memory specificity depends on mood; whereas non-depressed ruminators retrieve more specific memories, depressed ruminators retrieve fewer negative specific memories, (3) the relationship between cognitive complaints and memory specificity also depends on mood; whereas non-depressed patients who report more cognitive complaints retrieve more specific memories, depressed patients who report more cognitive complaints retrieve fewer specific memories, and (4) patients raised in less dysfunctional families retrieved more negatively overloaded specific memories. Further, there is no difference in memory specificity retrieval between traumatized and non-traumatized groups. In conclusion, being in contact with emotions allow patients to retrieve more specific memories. However, when the patient is depressed, an increased difficulty in controlling affect by being “stuck” in rumination or by feeling unable to think or concentrate impairs the ability of retrieving specific memories.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Fundamental Mechanical-behavior Studies of Annealed and Nano-particle-strengthened Nickel-based Alloys Using In-situ Neutron-diffraction Experiments</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Huang, E-Wen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This dissertation addresses two issues concerning the fundamental mechanical behavior of the nickel-based superalloys: (1) the deformation mechanisms and (2) the nano-precipitate-strengthening effect. The precipitates are known to fortify the mechanical behavior of the metallic alloys. These precipitates can interact with the matrix upon the applied load. While the precipitation strengthening has been facilitated for many purposes, this research puts forward the mechanistic understanding.
The dissertation considers the thesis that Deformation Mechanisms and Nanoprecipitate Strengthening and their effects on the microstructure are central to the mechanical behavior of nickel-based superalloys.
The experimental methods employed in this research are in-situ neutrondiffraction measurements, in-situ thermal characterization, ex-situ small-angle neutron-scattering, and electron microscopy experiments. The microscopic structural information obtained from the diffraction profiles is compared with the electronmicroscopy images to be complementary to each other. The microscopic features are connected with the macroscopic states, such as the applied stresses and temperature evolution to bridge the understanding of the bulk property.
This dissertation assumes that the macroscopic-material responses are the convolution of two contributions: the linear-elastic contribution and the plasticityinduced intra/inter-granular contribution. Within the context of this analysis, the mechanistic understanding of the deformation of the alloys is presented.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Study of Presidential Derailment in Public Research Universities</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Carver, Keith Shaw</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this interpretive, multiple case qualitative study was to explore factors associated with presidential derailments in public research universities. The case studies involved interviews, document analysis, and observation. The population consisted of four public research universities in the United States. These varied and diverse sources of information produced the data for the investigation.
The findings revealed five derailment themes among the four cases. These were: problems with interpersonal relationships, poor selection of advisors, flawed search processes, unethical behavior, and the failure of the president to change or adapt to the new organization upon assuming the presidency. Three of the five themes from public research universities related directly to Leslie and Van Velsor‘s (1996) derailment themes from the corporate sector. These were: problems with interpersonal relationships, inability to build or lead a team (poor selection of advisors), and the inability to change or adapt to the culture of an organization during a transition (failure to change or adapt to the new organization upon assuming the presidency).
Finally, implications for preventing presidential derailments and for improvement in the presidential selection process are presented.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Impact of Change on System of Systems Performance with an Application to Small and Medium Multihospital Systems</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Tayeb, Karima</dc:creator>
<dc:description>An entity that functions as a system of systems (SoS) is composed of multiple systems that individually provide various functions which collectively provide a holistic functional capability.  It is complex in design and function and tends to become even more complex over time as it evolves and responds to both internal and external changes. These changes might be in the composition or in the interoperability among its system members.  Since interoperability affects how well the members work as one system, managing it is critical to the performance of the SoS over its lifespan.
In support of this goal, this dissertation, through research and analysis of small-medium hospital systems, develops a descriptive approach to assist management in determining the impact that changes in membership and interoperability of member systems might have on SoS performance. A modeling approach was used to assess SoS performance before and  after changes. This model is part of an analysis framework called Tri-Ex that can be used by managers to evaluate proposed system changes. The procedures and techniques used are recommended for any future investigations into applicability for SoS performance in different domains; designing system structure with future capabilities in mind; and operational assessment during development.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Personality Profiles of Pre-service Teachers: An Examination of Discipline Differences and Predictive Validity on Future Job Satisfaction</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Beavers, Amy S</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Teacher job satisfaction has been shown to impact teacher retention,  attrition and absenteeism (Perrachione, Rosser, &amp; Peterson, 2008).  Given the significant investment of resources required to train  effective classroom teachers, retention of those teachers is important.  Research strongly supports the connection between personality traits and  occupational related outcomes such as work performance, career success,  and job satisfaction across occupational groups. Developing an  understanding of the personality profile of satisfied teachers as a  whole, as well as by teaching area, could serve to better equip teachers  for the reality of teaching, potentially having the ability to increase  job satisfaction. The purposes of this study were to investigate the  similarities and differences of personality traits within teacher  groups, as well as examine the effects of personality on job  satisfaction for teachers, through a longitudinal study using analysis  of covariance and multiple regression. When differences attributable to  gender were controlled, two groups within the teacher sample emerged.  Math, science, and physical education teachers were more resolute,  analytical and investigative, where as elementary, secondary English and  history, and special education teachers were more open-minded and  sensitive. Among the traits distinctive of the teacher occupational type  as a whole, teacher groups in this sample were generally extraverted,  warm, energetic, dutiful, and patient. Having an accurate understanding  of the personality traits that may influence teacher satisfaction could  serve to inform teacher preparation programs and best practices in  leadership for in-service teachers, potentially having the ability to  increase job satisfaction.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Choudhary, Shambhunath</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Activating mutations of ras genes are frequently found in human cancers. Since Ras proteins and their functions play an important role in tumorigenesis, it is important to develop targeted anticancer therapeutics against Ras-related human cancers. We observed that in addition to tumorigenic ability, oncogenic H-Ras possesses a novel proapoptotic ability to facilitate the induction of apoptosis by histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs), such as FR901228 and trichostatin A (TSA). HDACIs make up a new class of structurally diverse anticancer agents and have been shown to exhibit antimetastatic and antiangiogenic activities toward malignantly transformed cells. We detected that expression of oncogenic H-Ras potentiated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human and mouse cells to enhance HDACI-induced ROS, thereby contributing to the induction of selective apoptosis and caspase activation.
The first part (Part I) of this dissertation focuses on the understanding of Ras proteins, their role in normal and transformed cell physiology, and current treatment options against Ras-related human cancers, as well as the role of HDACIs and ROS in anticancer therapeutics. The next three parts (Part II-IV) focus on revealing the mechanisms for the novel pro-apoptotic ability of oncogenic H-Ras that allow HDACIs to induce selective apoptosis of the oncogenic H-Ras expressing cells. Results in Part II &amp; III verify the pro-apoptotic activity of oncogenic H-Ras in the increased susceptibility of human cancer cells to HDACIs. The caspase pathways, the B-Raf and extracellular signal regulated kinase pathway, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1, and core histone contents are regulated differently by FR901228 in oncogenic H-Ras–expressed cells than their counterparts in parental cells, contributing to the increased susceptibility to the induction of selective apoptosis. Results in Part IV describe the role of reactive oxygen species in the pro-apoptotic ability ofoncogenic H-Ras to enhance the cell susceptibility to HDACIs. Intracellular ROS was cooperatively up-regulated by oncogenc H-Ras and HDACI treatment to induce selective apoptosis of oncogenic H-Ras-expressing cells. The last section (Part V) summarizes the findings with their importance and discusses future directions.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Physical and Mental Health Interventions in a Rural, School-Based Setting: A comparative analysis of academic performance, behavioral outcomes, and attendance</dc:title>
<dc:creator>parris, heather n</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Abstract The purpose of this study was to determine the differences in academic achievement, behavioral health outcomes and attendance in poor, rural children receiving physical and mental health services regularly as opposed to those children not receiving the intervention. The intervention was a school-based health and mental health clinic located on the school’s campus. This study was analyzed by providing descriptive information for several variables including the number of suspensions per year, number of times corporal punishment was used as a means of correction, educational outcomes, total number of clinic visits per year, attendance percentages per year, and number of teacher and parent referrals to the school clinic. Data for this study were presented in multiple charts and graphs and schools are compared using descriptive information. The results suggested that as the number of clinic visits increased across the three year period, the numbers of, and rates of, corporal punishment in the clinic school decreased. In contrast, the available data suggested that across the first two years the numbers of, and rates of, corporal punishment increased in the control school. Further, in the majority of subject areas, the percentage of students’ proficiency levels in the clinic school increased across time and the percentages exceeded these in the control school. These findings were consistent with the hypotheses that there will be improvements in the behavioral outcomes associated with the presence of the clinic in the school. Unfortunately there were not enough data to conduct a test of statistical significance of the differences between schools for the third year.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Spokes, Pyramids, and Chiefs of Staff: Howard H. Baker, Jr. and the Reagan Presidency</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Haynes, Michael Lee</dc:creator>
<dc:description>One of the most compelling areas of research when considering the modern presidency is the role of the White House chief of staff (COS) and the direct impact it has on the presidency. The office of the president’s chief of staff is often referred to as the power behind the throne. Chiefs of staff exercise great authority and control within the White House Office (WHO) functioning as a filter or gatekeeper strictly controlling the access of information and people reaching the president. The COS is also one of the president’s closest advisers. James Baker, former chief of staff for Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush has stated the White House chief of staff is the second most powerful job in government. However, the position has commanded relatively little attention from presidential scholars. Nevertheless, understanding this component of the modern White House is important if we are to better explain why some presidencies are more effective than others. This study focuses on the chief of staff and how the office functions within the organizational and managerial structure of the White House as a key to understanding the effective operation of the modern presidency.
Specifically the study considers Howard H. Baker, Jr. and his tenure during the Ronald Reagan presidency. Relatively little research has been conducted exploring Baker’s tenure as COS, yet the Reagan presidency experienced a major transformation during this period – going from an administration in serious trouble to a stable presidency with high approval ratings. A closer study of the transformation process may provide a better understanding of the impact the COS has on the presidency. The study finds strong support for the thesis that the White House chief of staff is a critically important component within the modern presidency and has a direct impact on the president and the potential effectiveness of his administration. Howard Baker’s tenure as COS clearly demonstrates the dramatic changes chiefs of staff can produce within a presidency. In Baker’s case the impact was both substantial and positive in the rescue and rehabilitation of the Reagan presidency.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Ecological and Evolutionary Factors Affecting Rabies Virus Infection in Colonial Insectivorous Bats</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Turmelle, Amy S.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>An introductory section provides a review for the role of bats as reservoirs of infectious diseases, and highlights the rationale for investigations of host life history, ecology, and evolution in regard to bat epizootiology. Chapter 1 presents field investigations of life history, ecology, body condition, and rabies virus neutralizing antibody seroprevalence in six natural colonies of Brazilian free-tailed bats from caves and bridge roosts in Texas. Chapter 2 presents a replicate field investigation of life history, ecology, body condition, and rabies virus neutralizing antibody seroprevalence in six natural colonies of Brazilian free tailed bats from bridges and bat house roosts in Florida and Georgia. Chapter 3 evaluates the relative influence of local and landscape factors on life history, ecology, body condition and rabies virus neutralizing antibody seroprevalence in Brazilian free-tailed bats in the southern United States. Chapter 4 describes the role of host population genetic structure in big brown bat rabies virus epizootiology, and describes comparative pathogenicity of two big brown bat rabies virus isolates across several captive experimental infection studies. The information presented has been used in the development of individual, population, and metapopulation models of rabies virus epizootiology in bats.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>How Adult Students Experience Having Their Beliefs Challenged in an Undergraduate Religion Class: A Phenomenological Analysis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Frye, Steven Blake</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The challenging of one’s existing ideas has long been acknowledged as an integral component of the learning experience. In a university classroom, challenges are often inherent to the process. When challenges address personal beliefs, there is potential for the experience to be unsettling. The current study is designed to gain a deeper look into this phenomenon.
The purpose of this study is to examine the experiences of adult students in a college religion class who have encountered questions about and challenges to their previously held beliefs. The study was conducted with adult non-traditional students who have participated in an academically-focused college level religion class at a Baptist affiliated university with a liberal arts emphasis. Using the phenomenological research method developed at the University of Tennessee (Thomas &amp; Pollio, 2002), eight participants were interviewed regarding their experience. All were asked to talk about a time one of their beliefs was challenged in their undergraduate religion course.
Utilizing the concept of figure/ground as an interpretive framework, the data revealed three themes that stood out against the ground of the learners’ expectations of being challenged. First, participants experienced an environment of challenge filled with varied and powerful challenges that often came quickly. While some spoke of theological beliefs that were challenged, others described challenges to beliefs about others and how they would be treated in a religion class, the teachers’ pedagogy, and their own personal epistemology. The influence of professors stood out as a second theme as they set a tone for the class, and served as models for the environment. Professors had both positive and negative effects on the learners. The final theme deals with the choices participants made: the challenges caused some to broaden their mindsets, while others chose to not allow their beliefs to be corroded.
These findings reveal highly individualized learning experiences laden with the potential for powerful challenges to the learner’s beliefs and identity. The level of expectation for challenges to beliefs brought to the learning environment influenced the impact of the challenges. Teachers played a significant role in establishing an environment where effective reflective learning could occur.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Design and Synthesis of Novel Sultams: A Family of Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors and Modeling Studies of a Rhodium Catalyst</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kafri, Riyam</dc:creator>
<dc:description>3-Phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1,2-benzisothiazole 1,1 dioxide (NSC108406), identified as an HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor, is chosen for lead optimization. A series of analogues are docked using SYBYL FlexiDock into both wild-type (wt) reverse transcriptase (RT) and Tyr181 --&gt; Cys181 (Y181C) RT, from the dataset of efavirenz (Sustiva®) bound to the enzyme. Minimizations using genetic algorithms are performed, and the lowest energy conformations are evaluated. Five structures emerge as good fits either in both enzymes or only in Y181C RT. 3-(m-Cyclopropylphenyl)- and 3-(isopropylfuranyl)-2-methyl-2,3- dihydro-1,2-benzisothiazole 1,1-dioxides do not exhibit improved binding in wt RT over efavirenz. In the Y181C pocket, the furanyl ring oxygen is oriented towards Cys181, and the cyclopropyl group on the phenyl ring makes a strong contact with Tyr183. Three 3-(alkylethynyl)-2,3-dihydro-2-methyl-1,2-benzisothiazole 1,1-dioxides (ethynyl sultams) make very good contacts in both wt and Y181C RT.
Synthesis of the ethynyl sultams is attempted using the appropriate alkylethynyllithium reagents with saccharin, but 3,3-bisalkylethynyl-2,3-dihydro- 1,2-benzisothiazole 1,1-dioxides are the principal products. These are methylated to give the bisalkylated sultams. When docked into wt RT, they are consistently placed outside the pocket. In Y181C RT they make similar contacts to nevirapine, a first-generation NNRTI.
3-Chloro-1,2-benzisothiazole 1,1-dioxide is then coupled to the alkylethynyllithium reagents to give the desired monosubstituted products. (R,R)-N-(p-tolunesulfonyl)-1,2-diphenylethylenediamine-rhodium- (pentamethycycopentadienyl)-Cl [(R,R)-TSDPEN-Rh-Cl], an enantioselective catalyst for the reduction of imines, is used in an attempt to produce optically active sultams; however, the products are not optically active. The cyclopropyland cyclobutylethynyl bonds are reduced to the corresponding alkanes. These new cycloalkylethyl sultams, when docked into RT, exhibit a better fit in Y181C than wt RT, similar to that of efavirenz.
In a study on the mechanism of the enantioselective reduction of 3-alkylor aryl-imines by (R,R)-TSDPEN-Rh-Cl, a number of imines are docked into the catalyst cavity in two different approaches using the “original” approach that gives the observed enantioselectivity and the “reverse” approach, which is thought to give the opposite enantiomer. Molecular dynamic studies are carried out. In all 3-(aryl/alkyl)imine sultams, an average of at least 10 kcal/mol energy difference is observed between both approaches, showing probable structures for the intermediate complex in the catalytic cycle that accounts product stereochemistry.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Fabric-on-a-Chip: Toward Consolidating Packet Switching Functions on Silicon</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Matthews, William B.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The switching capacity of an Internet router is often dictated by the memory bandwidth required to bu¤er arriving packets. With the demand for greater capacity and improved service provisioning, inherent memory bandwidth limitations are encountered rendering input queued (IQ) switches and combined input and output queued (CIOQ) architectures more practical. Output-queued (OQ) switches, on the other hand, offer several highly desirable performance characteristics, including minimal average packet delay, controllable Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning and work-conservation under any admissible traffic conditions. However, the memory bandwidth requirements of such systems is O(NR), where N denotes the number of ports and R the data rate of each port. Clearly, for high port densities and data rates, this constraint dramatically limits the scalability of the switch.
In an effort to retain the desirable attributes of output-queued switches, while significantly reducing the memory bandwidth requirements, distributed shared memory architectures, such as the parallel shared memory (PSM) switch/router, have recently received much attention. The principle advantage of the PSM architecture is derived from the use of slow-running memory units operating in parallel to distribute the memory bandwidth requirement. At the core of the PSM architecture is a memory management algorithm that determines, for each arriving packet, the memory unit in which it will be placed. However, to date, the computational complexity of this algorithm is O(N), thereby limiting the scalability of PSM switches.
In an effort to overcome the scalability limitations, it is the goal of this dissertation to extend existing shared-memory architecture results while introducing the notion of Fabric on a Chip (FoC). In taking advantage of recent advancements in integrated circuit technologies, FoC aims to facilitate the consolidation of as many packet switching functions as possible on a single chip. Accordingly, this dissertation introduces a novel pipelined memory management algorithm, which plays a key role in the context of on-chip output- queued switch emulation. We discuss in detail the fundamental properties of the proposed scheme, along with hardware-based implementation results that illustrate its scalability and performance attributes.
To complement the main effort and further support the notion of FoC, we provide performance analysis of output queued cell switches with heterogeneous traffic. The result is a flexible tool for obtaining bounds on the memory requirements in output queued switches under a wide range of tra¢ c scenarios. Additionally, we present a reconfigurable high-speed hardware architecture for real-time generation of packets for the various traffic scenarios. The work presented in this thesis aims at providing pragmatic foundations for designing next-generation, high-performance Internet switches and routers.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Integration of European Union Borderlands: Polish Views on Cross-Border Mobility and Cooperation Across the Polish-German Border</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Brym, Michelle Janet</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The transformation of the Polish-German border from a carefully monitored border to an open border with no restrictions on the cross-border mobility of individuals was complete with Poland's full membership in the Schengen Agreement in the fall of 2007. Meanwhile, funding from the European Union since the early 1990s has been supporting the development of projects that require collaboration between Polish and German borderlanders. A chief mechanism for this has been the zoning of border regions into so-called euro-regions, zones of cross-border cooperation, that by financially supporting projects that require collaboration across the border encourage Polish and German organizations and towns in the border region to establish closer ties. In the summer and fall of 2007 during the final months of controls on the border, I interviewed Polish borderlanders living in the northwestern provinces of Lubuskie and Zachodniopomorskie to learn how successful these policies have been at reducing the divisive effect of the border between European member countries. Surveys and open-ended interviews were used to capture Polish borderlanders opinions on the changes in their cross border mobility, to learn about their awareness of euro-regions and to explore how they identify with the region. The findings of this study are meant to contribute to a better understanding of the early stages of European Union integration in Central Europe.
Despite the delight borderlanders in my study expressed over the closing of custom checkpoints along the border, I found that linguistic and economic differences continue to influence individuals' decisions to cross the border and structure their interactions with German borderlanders. Although it has become relatively easy for borderlanders to cross the border, most participants only cross the border once a year. And although the majority of borderlanders in my study held positive views on cooperating with German communities across the border their actions appear to be driven by the perceived economic benefits of cross-border cooperation and not a sense of belonging in an multicultural European society.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>“Tentative Relations: Secession and War in the Central Ohio River Valley, 1859-1862”</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Jenness, Timothy Max</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In the fall of 1859, John Brown launched a raid on the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia, and in so doing arguably fired the first salvo of the Civil War.  That his raid occurred in the border area between North and South should come as no surprise because it was in that area where Americans were the most divided.  Citizens across the border state region–that area that comprised the lower North and upper South–soon found themselves caught between two hostile sections.  Based on an analysis of letters, journals, newspapers, and public documents, this dissertation is a study of one portion of that border region, the central Ohio River Valley, during the momentous years between Brown’s raid and the early weeks of 1862, when Indiana Senator Jesse Bright was expelled from the United States Senate for treasonous behavior.  Citizens who lived in the river counties between Cincinnati and Louisville shared important economic, cultural, and socio-political views that united them and created a regional bond capable of withstanding the centrifugal pull of sectionalism despite the omnipresent influence of slavery.  These trans-river bonds moderated their response to secession and reinforced their Unionist proclivities.  Their fidelity to the Union strengthened Abraham Lincoln’s hand and helped to insure that the Union would endure.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Value Similarity and Its Relationship to Interpersonal Relationship Quality and Identity: Perceptions of Self, Partner, and Ideal Partner</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Clement, Jennifer G.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The exploration of interpersonal relationships has led to the recognition that similarity has played a large role in the relationship quality, e.g. satisfaction, of dyads, specifically romantic dyads. Three categories of similarity have been shown to best predict satisfaction: communication, attitudes, and values. This study examined the actual, perceived, and ideal value similarity of heterosexual romantic dyads at the University of Tennessee and assessed relationship quality which included satisfaction, intimacy, trust, and social provisions. Using stepwise regressions and Pearson Product correlations this study determined that actual, perceived, and ideal value similarity significantly predicted the relationship quality of the individual and the couple. Results showed that no difference was found between actual similarity and perceived similarity in their ability to significantly predict relationship quality. This study primarily explored the relationships of values of the self, partner, and ideal partner in order to further understand relationship quality and identity. Intraindividual and dyadic correlations were formed to assess the degree of similarity of values for each gender and the couple. Results demonstrated that ideal value perceptions were significantly and positively related to relationship quality and also revealed a gender difference. For example, when an individual’s rating of their partner was correlated with the rating of an ideal partner for each gender, results demonstrated a gender difference where only male correlations significantly predicted relationship quality. Possible implications for future research concerning value similarity, gender differences, and identity were then discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Sexual Objectification and Substance Abuse in Young Adult Women</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Carr, Erika Ann</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Objectification Theory (Frederickson &amp; Roberts, 1997) provides a framework for understanding the experiences of women living in a culture that sexualizes the female body. The purpose of this study was to extend the tenets of Objectification Theory by postulating that external and internalized experiences of sexual objectification may be related to women’s substance abuse in a sample of 289 young adult females. Findings indicated that sexual objectification experiences and self-objectification were both positively correlated with alcohol abuse. Sexual objectification was also positively correlated with nicotine abuse and other drug abuse. Furthermore, the findings provided support for a theorized mediated model in which sexual objectification was linked to women’s substance abuse both directly and indirectly via self-objectification, body shame, and depression.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Relationship Between Adaptation Patterns of Recent Korean Immigrants and Team Identification with the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball Team: A Mixed Methods Study</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kim, Ji-Ho</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this explanatory mixed-methods study was to understand how Korean immigrants develop team identification with the Atlanta Braves and MLB teams with Korean players. This study involved two research phases. In the quantitative phase, the relationships between variables in the conceptual framework were tested based on quantitative data. The data were collected at Korean ethnic churches in Atlanta and at the championship game of the Atlanta Korean Adult Baseball League. The primary purpose of the follow-up qualitative research in the second phase was to elaborate and explain the results of the quantitative data analysis in the first phase. Four hundred six Korean immigrants in the Atlanta area participated in the survey, and 391 obtained data were valid for the measurement model and structure model test. SPSS 18 and AMOS 18 were utilized to test reliability, construct validity, measurement model, and structure model. The quantitative data analysis showed acceptable reliability, construct validity (convergent validity and discriminant validity), measurement model fit (CMIN/DF = 1.785; CFI = .963; RMSEA = .045) and structure model fit (the integration group: CMIN/DF = 2.396, CFI = .982, RMSEA = .060; segregation group: CMIN/DF = 2.499, CFI = .980, RMSEA = .062). Thirteen semi-structured interviews were conducted for the follow-up qualitative research. The research participants were selected based on a two-stage case selection method (Ivankova, 2004). The interview questions for the follow-up qualitative research were developed based on the results of the statistical analysis of the relationship among variables in the conceptual framework. Both the results of the quantitative and qualitative research showed that the adaptation patterns of Korean immigrants with involvement in sports and MLB games were significant v predictors in explaining team identification of Korean immigrants with the Atlanta Braves and MLB teams with Korean players. At the same time, however, the results of the quantitative and qualitative research suggested that a holistic understanding of Korean immigrants‟ lives in Atlanta should be required for a better comprehension of their team identification with the Atlanta Braves and MLB teams with Korean players.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Alzheimer's Disease Caregiver Burden: Does Resilience Matter?</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Scott, Cathy B</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Caring for an individual with Alzheimer’s disease is especially challenging and impacts every aspect of the lives of the informal caregivers. Informal caregiving is defined as unpaid care provided by family or friends to people with a chronic illness or disability (Young &amp; Newman, 2002). Caregiver burden involves the physical, psychological, social and emotional problems experienced by a caregiver of an impaired loved one (Gwyther &amp; George, 2006).  Alzheimer’s disease caregivers report more depression than their caregiving and non-caregiving peers, experience increased physical decline, and often experience financial challenges. Evidence suggests Alzheimer’s disease caregiver burden is a result of both care recipient and caregiver factors. Pearlin et al’s Stress Process model (1990) is widely used to examine triggers in caregiver burden. The model consists of antecedents, stressors, and outcomes. Few studies have examined moderators in the burden process in Alzheimer’s disease caregiving. Whether resilience accounts for variance in outcomes associated with caregiver burden is not addressed in the literature. Data from a convenience sample of Alzheimer’s disease caregivers (N=111) were examined for the purpose of exploring the moderating effect of resilience on the relationship between stressors and caregiver burden predictors. RESULTS: Resilience did not moderate the relationship between the caregiver stressors and caregiver burden. However, results indicated a relationship between resilience and caregiver burden. Specifically, as resilience increases, caregiver burden decreased. This finding highlights the importance of Alzheimer’s caregivers and implementing support and interventions that will increase their resilience.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Personality Traits and Career Decidedness: An Empirical Study of University Students</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Smith, Ryan M.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Research on vocational behavior has made progress in identifying broad personality traits associated with career indecision; however, important questions remain unanswered about the temporal stability of relationships between broad personality traits and Career Decidedness (CD), and about the role of narrow personality traits as predictors of CD, both of which were addressed in this longitudinal field study. A total of 2,046 undergraduate students completed an online personality inventory and CD questionnaire. A sub-group (N=267) responded to a follow-up questionnaire seven months later. Results indicated, as hypothesized, that CD correlated positively with the broad (Big Five) personality traits, openness, conscientiousness, and agreeableness. However, CD did not correlate as expected with the broad trait, extraversion, and correlated significantly and inversely with the broad trait, neuroticism, only for low-achievement students. Results showed that the narrow traits of optimism and work drive correlated significantly and positively with CD, and that these narrow traits accounted for more variance in CD (11.2%) than broad traits (.5%). CD correlated positively with chronological age, as predicted. However, Career Decidedness only increased through the first three of four years of college, and contrary to predictions, showed a non-significant decline in the senior year. In an unexpected finding based only on the sub-group who completed the second set of questionnaires, the relationship of personality and CD strengthened over the 7-month span of this study, yet instability within CD warrants caution. Results suggest questions for future research and implications for practice in vocational psychology.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Identifying Mechanisms Associated with Innate Immunity in Cows Genetically Susceptible to Mastitis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Elliott, Alexandra Alida</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Mastitis, or mammary gland inflammation, causes the greatest loss in profit for dairy producers. Mastitis susceptibility differs among cows due to environmental, physiological, and genetic factors. Prior research identified a genetic marker in a chemokine receptor, CXCR1, associated with mastitis susceptibility and decreased neutrophil migration. Current research seeks to identify reasons behind mastitis susceptibility by validating this model through in vivo challenge with Streptococcus uberis and studying specific mechanisms causing impaired neutrophil migration. Holstein cows with GG (n=19), GC (n=28), and CC (n=20) genotypes at CXCR1+777 were challenged intramammarily with S. uberis strain UT888. After challenge 68% of quarters from GG genotype, 74% from CC genotype and only 47% from GC genotype cows had ≥10 colony forming units/ml S. uberis for at least two sampling time points (P&lt;0.05). However, among infected cows, number of S. uberis, somatic cell count, rectal temperature, milk scores and mammary scores were comparable among genotypes throughout infection. These findings suggest that cows with GC genotypes may be more resistant to S. uberis mastitis, but have similar responses if infected. To better understand the mechanisms associated with disease resistance, migration patterns in neutrophils from cows with different CXCR1+777 genotypes were evaluated. Neutrophils from cows with GG (n=11) and CC (n=11) genotypes were isolated and stimulated with zymosan activated sera (ZAS). Cells were fixed and stained for F-actin and evaluated for F-actin content, distribution, and cell morphology. Neutrophils from CC cows had significantly lower average F-actin polymerization than GG cows v (P=0.05). Directed migration of neutrophils from GG (n=10) and CC (n=10) genotypes was imaged and tracking data was analyzed for individual cells. Cells from GG genotype traveled further on an X axis and had higher X/Y movement towards IL8 compared to CC genotype, meaning they moved more directly towards IL8. Our findings suggest lower F-actin polymerization in combination with lower ability to directly move towards IL8 could impair neutrophil response to infection in cows with a CC genotype and may contribute to increased mastitis susceptibility. Finding what makes certain cows more susceptible to mastitis could lead to strategies aimed at improved prevention and treatment of mastitis.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Toward a Progressive African Americanism: Africanism and Intraracial Class Conflict in Twentieth- and Early Twenty-First-Century African American Literature</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sanders-Senu, LaRonda Meeshay</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this work, I explore how African American authors and texts have contributed to or confronted what Toni Morrison calls “Africanism” in Playing in the Dark.   I argue that the construction of blackness by non-black people and its consequent racial stigma, imbuing skin color with mental and physical inferiority, functions in an intraracial context to obscure the solidarity of all African Americans irrespective of their socioeconomic status. My work spans the twentieth and the beginning of the twenty-first centuries, investigating representations of the middle class who seek to deny or ignore the impact that a Eurocentric value system has on their lives and the lives of the black majority. These texts also illustrate the struggle to reconcile social mobility and economic progress with the persistence of the cultural trauma of slavery and racial stigma, as well as the struggle between exclusionary claims of African American authenticity and more complicated middle-class and black majority constructions of African American identity.  I correct claims that the tension between African American authenticity and educational and economic progress is a new phenomenon, demonstrating that this tension extends back to the beginning of the twentieth century and arguably even to the period of Reconstruction.  My dissertation also reveals the mythical nature of the postracial ideal, suggesting that contemporary African American investment in postracial ideology is the product of a desire to reflect and obtain an elusive “Americanism” that has never been unreservedly available to African Americans.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Finite Element Study of the Contact Stiffness of Homogenous Materials and Thin Films</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Xu, Haitao</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The applicability of the stiffness equation S=2Era to elastic and elastic-plastic homogeneous materials and thin films on substrates is studied by finite element techniques. It is found that the stiffness equation works well in all these materials provided that a correction factor β is included. For elastic homogenous materials, the correction factor is examined for different friction conditions, Poisson’s ratios, and indenter cone angles. In the case of elastic-plastic indentation with a 70.3° cone, the correction factor is very close to that for elastic indentation of a matching conical hole, which provides a convenient way to model the effects of plasticity.
Nanoindentation measurements using the stiffness equation for film/substrate systems may be affected by the substrate properties. To address this issue, a new equation describing the relationship between the effective compliance and the elastic properties of the film and the substrate for flat cylindrical punch indentation is derived. To apply this to conical indentation, it is shown that an effective film thickness should be used in the new relation to account for the geometry difference between a conical indenter and a flat punch. Finite element analysis (FEA) is used to obtain a simple equation which can be used to determine the effective film thickness, which is independent of the elastic properties of the films and substrates for compliant films on stiff substrates. The applicability of the new relation is examined by comparing it to FEA of elastic-plastic indentation by a cone. The new relation is also compared to Yu’s approximate analytical solution to determine which is more accurate for obtaining the true contact radius from the measured stiffness. Although Yu’s solution applies to a broader range of materials, the new relation has distinct advantages in that it can be written in a simple algebraic form.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Evaluation of genetic diversity of flowering dogwood (Cornus florida L.) in the eastern United States using microsatellites.</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hadziabdic, Denita</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Flowering dogwood (Cornus florida L.) populations have experienced severe declines caused by dogwood anthracnose in the past three decades. Mortality has ranged from 48 to 98%, raising the concern that genetic diversity of this native tree has been reduced significantly. Microsatellite data were used to evaluate the level and distribution of genetic variation throughout much of the native range of the tree. In the first conducted study, we found that genetic variation in areas affected by anthracnose was as high as or higher than areas without die-offs. We found evidence of four widespread, spatially contiguous genetic clusters. However, there was little relationship between geographic distance and genetic difference. These observations suggest that high dispersal rates and large effective population sizes have so far prevented rapid loss of genetic diversity. The effects of anthracnose on demography and community structure are likely to be far more consequential than short-term genetic effects.
The second study examined levels and distribution of genetic variation of C. florida throughout Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP). Significant genetic structure at both landscape and local levels were found. We infer that two genetic clusters exist within the park, mostly separated by the main dividing ridge of the Great Smoky Mountains. The differentiation is statistically significant, but subtle, with gene flow evident through low-elevation corridors. It seems unlikely that recent demographic dynamics have resulted in a depletion of genetic variation in flowering dogwoods.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Mongo Béti ou l’écriture d’un révolté en exil: anatomie, analyse et impact de ses critiques à travers ses articles dans « Peuples noirs, peuples africains » (1978 à 1991)</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Adabra, Kodjo</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Following their independence in the 1960s the new governments of such French-speaking, African nations as Togo, Ivory Coast, Congo and Chad (to name only few), for the most part embraced policies that were authoritarian. A direct upshot socially of the lack of free speech imposed by certain African regimes was the migration of a large number of intellectuals from the black continent, yearning to rediscover their voices in more developed, democratic countries. Many, while living in exile, turned to writing or continued to write in such a way that the painful stories of the Africa they left behind could unfold before the eyes of the larger world and somehow bring a positive change to the leadership in Africa.
One of these committed Francophone African writers of the Diaspora was Mongo Béti. In my dissertation, I explore the effects of an exile’s life on this writer's journalistic work by a careful analysis of the articles he published from 1978 to 1991 in the bimonthly review, &quot;Peuples noirs, peuples africains&quot;, which he co-founded with his wife, Odile Tobner. My approach is to focus on the dual causality in Béti’s literary efforts through a better acquaintance with his review: the migratory factor that conveys, on the one hand, the notion of cultural integration and the creative spirit in perpetual exile and, on the other hand, the neocolonial factor that constantly connects the protagonist to his origins as he radically refutes poor governance and dictatorship in his home country and in the so-called independent francophone Africa, or to the ex-colonizer reluctant to give up its ill-fated 'mission civilisatrice'.
Through later research, I hope to develop my work by thematically analyzing three formative periods of the author's life: the period before his exile, the time during his thirty two years of exile, and the period after his exile, in order to better contextualize factors of influence and their varying degree over time in his writing, both journalistic and novelistic.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Structure-Function Studies of the Large Subunit of Ribonucleotide Reductase from Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Fairman, James Wesley</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Sufficient pools of deoxyribonucleotide triphophates (dNTPs) are essential for the high fidelity replication and repair of DNA, the hereditary material for a majority of living organisms. Ribonucleotide reductase (Rnr) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of de-novo DNA synthesis, the reduction of ribonucleosides to deoxyribonucleosides. Since the cell relies primarily upon ribonucleotide reductase for its dNTPs, both the cellular levels and activity of Rnr are heavily regulated, especially when DNA damage occurs or during replication blocks in the cell cycle. If dNTP pools become too high, too low, or imbalanced, genomic instability results, leading to either the formation of cancerous cells or cell death. High levels of dNTPs are required by actively propagating cells for the replication of new DNA molecules. Therefore, Rnr makes an excellent target for anti-cancer, anti-microbial, and anti-fungal chemotherapeutic agents.
Deficiencies in the cellular mismatch repair (MMR) machinery have been linked to genetic instability and carcinogenesis. Two alleles of Rnr1 were recently discovered, Rnr1S269P and Rnr1S610F, which have a mismatch repair synthetic lethal (msl) phenotype in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells with missing or defective MMR genes. To uncover the molecular mechanism of the msl phenotype in these two mutants, recombinant Rnr1p-S269P and Rnr1p-S610F were subjected to in vitro activity assays, X-ray crystallography, and in vitro nucleoside-binding assays (Chapter 3). The Rnr1S269P allele was shown to dysregulate specificity cross talk by X-ray crystallography experiments, leading to reduced levels of dATP in the cell. A 2-fold reduction in binding of ADP substrate was observed in the Rnr1S610F allele, however reduction of the kcat is believed to cause the observed msl phenotype in this mutant.
The first X-ray crystal structures of the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase from Homo sapiens (hRRM1) are also presented here (Chapter 4). The hRRM1●TTP and hRRM1●TTP●GDP structures describe the binding of effector and substrate to the specificity and catalytic sites. In addition, the two structures hRRM1●TTP●ATP and hRRM1●TTP●dATP are the first X-ray crystal structures of Rnr from any species with the allosteric activity site occupied with the natural ligands ATP and dATP. Size exclusion chromatography data and a low resolution X-ray crystal structure of hexameric S. cerevisiae Rnr provide a model for dATP-dependent oligomerization.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Differentiated Intrusion Detection and SVDD-based Feature Selection for Anomaly Detection</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kang, Inho</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Most of existing intrusion detection techniques treat all types of attacks equally without any differentiation of the risk they pose to the information system. However, certain types of attacks are more harmful than others and their detection is critical to protection of the system. This study proposes a novel differentiated anomaly detection method that can more precisely detect intrusions of specific types of attacks.
Although many researchers have been developed many efficient intrusion detection methods, fewer efforts have been made to extract effective features for host-based intrusion detection. In this study, we propose a new framework based on new viewpoints about system activities to extract host-based features, which can guide further exploration for new features.
There are few feature selection methods for anomaly detections although lots of studies have been done for the feature selection both in classification and regression problems. This study proposes new support vector data description (SVDD)-based feature selection methods such as SVDD-R2-recursive feature elimination (RFE), SVDD-RFE and SVDDGradient method. Concrete experiments with both simulated and the Defense advanced research projects agency (DARPA) datasets shows promising performance of the proposed methods.
These achievements in this dissertation could significantly contribute to anomaly detection field. In addition, the proposed differentiated detection and SVDD-based feature selection methods would benefit even other application areas beyond intrusion detection</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Emergent Phenomena in Spatially Confined Manganites</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ward, Thomas Z.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Rare earth manganites exhibit colossal magnetoresistance (CMR). There is evidence that alloyed single crystal materials in this class can display electronic inhomogeneity in which areas with vastly different electronic and magnetic properties can form and coexist in phase separated domains ranging in size from a few nanometers to micrometers. This phase separation (PS) is of particular interest, as it has been suggested that it is the central feature that leads to CMR in manganites, the Mott transition in VO2 and may play a role in high-TC superconductivity in cuprates. However there is debate as to its precise role.
The purpose of my research is to answer fundamental questions about the specific role of PS in complex oxides. I reduce single crystal thin films of an electronically phase separated manganite to the scale of their inherent electronic phase domains near the metal-insulator transition. Unlike transport measurements done on bulk or thin films where the electrons follow only the metallic path of least resistance, this configuration forces electrons to travel through both the metallic and insulating regions residing in the material. This has led to observations of several new phenomena such as a reemergent metal-insulator transition, ultra-sharp jumps in resistivity at the metal-insulator transition, and the first high resolution observation of single domain electronic phase transitions in the time domain.
While the manganites will be the primary focus throughout this dissertation, the spatial confinement techniques presented here are not limited to only these materials. They can be applied to any phase separated system to probe regions resistively hidden to transport measurements.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Scanning Probe Microscopy: Applications for Genomic Research</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Allison, David Post</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The inauguration of the International Human Genome Initiative in the later part of the 1980’s coincided with the development of scanning probe microscopy (SPM). SPM was a good fit as one of the new technologies that might be implemented to sequence or map DNA and perhaps make a major contribution toward the goal of sequencing the entire human genome. Although the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) was invented in 1982 [Binnig 1982] and the atomic force microscope (AFM) in 1986 [Binnig 1986], it was not until 1987 that the first STM became commercially available; the AFM became available in 1989.
Our group entered this exciting new scientific adventure in genome research towards the end of 1987. An interdisciplinary team was assembled that capitalized on our expertise in the fabrication and use of scanning tunneling microscopes. Additionally, we purchased one of the first commercially available scanning tunneling microscopes. Rounding out the team was expertise in imaging biomolecules such as DNA using electron microscopy.
Our initial research focused on STM imaging and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) of 1) tobacco mosaic virus adsorbed to gold surfaces [Mantovani 1990] and 2) DNA passively mounted on highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surfaces [Allison 1990]. Our spectroscopy results with DNA encouraged speculation that the electronic signatures of nucleotide bases might be used to sequence DNA. However, in this early work we also discovered that simply adsorbing either virus or DNA to gold or HOPG surfaces resulted in substantial amounts of the sample being removed by the STM tunneling tip.
In order to more firmly immobilize negatively charged DNA molecules onto surfaces for STM scanning, we created gold sample surfaces with positive functionality mediated by a self-assembled monolayer of 2-dimethylaminoethane thiol. Using this method, we produced the first reported images of entire genetically functional plasmid DNA molecules obtained by STM [Allison 1992a, Allison 1992b Allison 1993, Bottomley 1992].
Efforts initiated by our laboratory to restriction map DNA molecules by AFM imaging were successful. This was accomplished by physically mapping the location of a mutant EcoRI endonuclease that binds to but does not cleave large DNA clones. Our new AFM technology was pioneered as an alternative to conventional gel-based restriction mapping; it was first demonstrated on plasmid DNA molecules [Allison 1996] and later on larger molecules including cosmid clones [Allison 1997]. This technology should prove to be more effective than conventional mapping methods because by using AFM mapping neither the number nor the proximity of restriction sites to one another is problematic.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Governmental Fragmentation and Rural Sprawl: Case Studies Examining Governmental Structure and Limited Public Choice</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Carter, Daniel C.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Marion County, Tennessee was formed in 1817 and currently all seven cities within its boundaries combined account for 34,202 (thousand) acres. Within a short period time, Marion County will experience over 40,000 (thousand) acres of traditional forestland being converted to private, rural residential development. These former forested tracts are all located in remote areas of the county with very few existing public services. The intent of this dissertation is to demonstrate how government structure and funding mechanisms result in a type of rural sprawl that is rapidly fragmenting thousands of acres throughout Tennessee and the United States as timber companies sell their forest lands to private developers. This dissertation contends that local governments in Tennessee are not designed by state statute to address the public need of open space and recreation; nor does their fragmented institutional structure result in well-planned decisions related to growth. As a result, private development interests appear to determine how land is divided and utilized in the rural counties of Tennessee and specifically the South Cumberland Plateau in Tennessee.
This dissertation will explore how devolution has created a climate whereby local officials support and encourage rural growth for the rational purpose of revenue production, without considering the potential negative consequences of unplanned growth. The first case study of this dissertation outlines a series of actions taken by various governmental actors in response to a recent drought situation where towns were running out of drinking water, while rural water lines were being extended to new development. The second case study chronologically outlines specific actions taken by governmental units to consider whether to sell recreation land for private development. The third case study chronologically outlines a series of actions taken to limit sprawl through conservation with the support of local officials. Each case study occurred simultaneously in one county with interrelated governmental actors and events.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>México Visto desde la Literatura de su Frontera Norte: Identidades Propias de la Transculturación y la Migración</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Celaya, Lori</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Until recently, Mexican identity at Mexico’s northern border had been viewed as a marginal manifestation of Mexican culture. This characterization resulted from centrist ideologies that were rooted in a homogeneous concept of mexicanness. Furthermore, the belief that the border was a peripheral culture was influenced by the border’s proximity to the United States. Over time, border identity has evolved to one which affirms and defines itself through its diversity. Such a concept has been captured in a view of the Mexican nation that has been increasingly contested from different vantage points which are both convergent and divergent.
This dissertation analyzes the formation of Mexico’s northern border identity from two perspectives: that of writers from Mexico’s northern border and that of writers from Mexico’s presumed center, Mexico City. The works analyzed here by writers from México’s Northern Border consist of Luis Humberto Crosthwaite’s El gran pretender (1994) Victor Espinoza Valle’s Don Crispín (1995) Federico Campbell’s Todo lo de las focas (1990) Ricardo Aguilar- Melantzón’s Que es un soplo la vida (2003) and Norma Elia Cantú’s Canícula (1995). This representative body of narrative works is characterized by an appropriation and resignification of its multiple influences and geographical location.
Unlike the cultural fluidity that characterizes the writers from the northern border; many intellectuals from Mexico City view the nation as a homogenous whole. Yet, this tradition is being challenged in light of the growing influence of the border communities. This change in perception is certainly evident in the writers from Mexico City examined in this dissertation who question the premise of a single center. This new cultural pluralism characterizes in Ignacio Solares’ Columbus (1995) Elena Poniatowska’s Las mil y una (2000) Carlos Monsiváis’ “La frontera y el centro:Encuentro de mitologías” (1998) and Carlos Fuentes La frontera de cristal (1995). The present study examines the extent to which these works challenge the established social and literary institutions. In other words, we argue that they deconstruct the notion of center versus periphery, and in the process, they effectively decenter the traditional notion of a homogenous Mexican nation.
The authors studied here illustrate a public discourse that depicts many of the debates that seek to define Mexico’s cultural identity—a discourse which clearly shows the formation of a contested heterogeneous culture. Clearly, border identities are an ongoing negotiation of their multiple influences. In that regard, the present study seeks to add to the understanding of those processes of transculturation that place emphasis on border identity as a fluid and multiple manifestation of Mexican culture. In addition, this dissertation seeks to contribute to further dialogue about the ways in which process of identity construction and appropriation at Mexico’s Northern Border are re-signifying Mexico’s national imaginary.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>SAFDetection:Sensor Analysis based Fault Detection in Tightly-CoupledMulti-Robot Team Tasks</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Li, Xingyan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This dissertation addresses the problem of detecting faults based on sensor analysis for tightly-coupled multi-robot team tasks. The approach I developed is called SAFDetection, which stands for Sensor Analysis based Fault Detection, pronounced “Safe Detection”. When dealing with robot teams, it is challenging to detect all types of faults because of the complicated environment they operate in and the large spectrum of components used in the robot system. The SAFDetection approach provides a novel methodology for detecting robot faults in situations when motion models and models of multi-robot dynamic interactions are unavailable. The fundamental idea of SAFDetection is to build the robots’ normal behavior model based on the robots’ sensor data. This normal behavior model not only describes the motion pattern for the single robot, but also indicates the interaction among the robots in the same team. Inspired by data mining theory, it combines data clustering techniques with the generation of a probabilistic state transition diagram to model the normal operation of the multi-robot system.
The contributions of the SAFDetection approach include: (1) providing a way for a robot system to automatically generate a normal behavior model with little prior knowledge; (2) enabling a robot system to detect physical, logic and interactive faults online; (3) providing a way to build a fault detection capability that is independent of the particular type of fault that occurs; and (4) providing a way for a robot team to generate a normal behavior model for the team based the individual robot’s normal behavior models. SAFDetection has two different versions of implementation on multi-robot teams: the centralized approach and the distributed approach; the preferred approach depends on the size of the robot team, the robot computational capability and the network environment.
The SAFDetection approach has been successfully implemented and tested in three robot task scenarios: box pushing (with two robots) and follow-the-leader (implemented with two- and five-robot teams). These experiments have validated the SAFDetection approach and demonstrated its robustness, scalability, and applicability to a wide range of tightly-coupled multi-robot applications.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Using Sport to Build Community: Service-Learning with Iraqi Refugees</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Huffman, Ashleigh Morgan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to explore the connections between Sport for Development and Peace (SDP), service-learning, and community-university partnerships through the implementation of the Service-Learning: Sport and Community Development (SCD) class. It was my hope that this research would produce a usable model, a framework for other scholars and practitioners interested in developing community-university partnerships. I wanted this project to not only answer the “why” questions for SDP and service-learning, but also the “how” questions – specifically, how to create a reflexive and collaborative partnership that balances the needs of the community and university. I wanted to create something riveting and real, something inspiring and authentic, and something more inclusive than a first-person programmer or instructor account of the experience (Darnell, 2007; Eyler &amp; Giles, 1999; Millington, 2010; Stoecker &amp; Tryon, 2009).
Much like the goals of the class, this research was designed to stimulate and encourage others to move toward a more critical and engaged community agenda. To do that, I needed to create a research text that readers could “keep in their minds and feel in their bodies the complexities of concrete moments of lived experience” (Ellis, 2004, p. 30). For that reason, I chose narrative inquiry (Clandinin &amp; Connelly, 2000) as the primary method of representation, coupled with performance narratives (Denzin, 2003) and poetics (Glesne, 2006; Ely, 2007).
Based on the data collected from 49 qualitative interviews, 500 pages worth of reflective journals, and 200 pages of electronically recorded field notes, I created a visual community-university partnership model that illustrates the connections between SDP and service-learning as implemented in the SCD class. In addition to the visual model, I constructed narratives to detail the progression of the SCD experience over time, beginning with the common language of sport and ending in complete investment and reciprocity. As a result of this research, it has become clear that if implemented with intentionality, careful consideration, community collaboration, and reflexivity, that sport-based service-learning initiatives can enhance student learning, improve community welfare, and strengthen ties between the community and the university.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>NOVEL CONSTITUTIVELY ACTIVE POINT MUTATIONS IN THE NH2 DOMAIN OF CXCR2 CAPTURE THE RECEPTOR IN DIFFERENT ACTIVATION STATES</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Park, Giljun</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Chemokines are structurally and functionally related 8-10 kDa proteins defined by four conserved cysteine residues. They consist of a superfamily of proinflammatory mediators that promote the recruitment of various kinds of leukocytes and other cell types through binding to their respective chemokine receptor, a member of the GPCR family. Abnormal control of this system results in various diseases including tumorigenesis and cancer metastasis. Deregulation can occur when constitutively active mutant (CAM) chemokine receptors are locked in the “on” position. This can lead to cellular transformation/tumorigenesis. A viral CAM receptor, ORF74, that can cause tumors in humans, also has homology to human CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2), which is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) expressed on neutrophils, some monocytes, endothelial cells, and some epithelial cells. CXCR2 activation with ELR+ CXC chemokines induces leukocyte migration, trafficking, cellular differentiation, angiogenesis and cellular transformation. Using a high throughput yeast screen we identified a novel point mutation, D9H, in CXCR2, which leads to constitutive activation (CA). Generation of positively charged substitutions, D9K and D9R, and D143V as a positive control resulted in CA CXCR2 with differential levels of cellular transformation. To further investigate how D9 mutations lead to differential CA, we used inhibitors of known signal transduction pathways. Pertusiss toxin (PTX) sensitivity in foci formation assays demonstrated that D9R uses the Gi subunit like WTCXCR2 and D143V, while D9H and D9K do not. All CA receptors use the JAK pathway based on sensitivity to the inhibitor, AG490. Phosphorylation of PLC-beta 3 and sensitivity to the PLC-beta 3 inhibitor, U73122, implicates that mutant receptors such as D143V, D9H, D9K, and D9R utilize the Gq/11 subunit. Interestingly, D9R use both Gi and Gq/11 subunits. All of the CA receptors induced phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) indicating a transactivation between CXCR2 and EGFR. These data describe two novel and important findings. First, N-terminal CXCR2 controls activation and signaling using multiple G protein subunits to elicit downstream signaling. Second, our work supports the “functional selectivity” model for GPCR activation. That is, mimicking agonist activation, CA CXCR2 receptors have multiple conformational states that lead to differential activation.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>New Media Migration: Digitization and Computer Networking Technology Use in Three Community Newspapers</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Taylor, Larry Shane</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The study contributes to the understanding of how technology adoption effects organizations in structural and procedural operations. Specifically, this investigation was motivated by the perceived need to understand how digitization and networking technology is affecting how a community newspaper is produced. At its core, this study seeks to provide a foundation to focus efforts to understand what digitization and networking technologies mean to the practice of community newspapers by first making it clear what is happening. By establishing a framework of distinct identification for the phenomenon, more accurately aimed study of it can begin to occur. This, in turn, can be helpful in shaping the process of studying similar conditions in other professional arenas.
The study provides a detailed qualitative analysis of the practical effect of digitization and computer networking technology on community newspapers. To guide this process, the study established clear working definitions for the key components; community newspaper, digitization and networking technology and effect. The study defined a community newspaper as any print news publication organization, regardless of circulation size or geographic location, which does not publish on consecutive days and which has as its primary editorial and advertising focus local content. Digitization and networking technologies were seen to encompass the range of technologies that exist to render information into digital form and to facilitate its transfer in digital form from one point to another. Effect was considered distinctly practical, the results of the technology on the process of producing the newspaper. The study reveals the currently limited scope of research related to digitization and computer networking technology and community journalism.
The study explores three individual cases to understand accurately and in detail the effect of digitization and networking technology on each community newspaper studied. Analysis of the data collected from each case study established the actual presence and identity of the digitization and networking technology in the community newspaper, and a detailed understanding of the observable effect of this technology on the processes of producing the newspaper product. Strong commonality in the findings of the three cases suggested that technology adoption has an effect on organizational structure as well as performance processes for incorporated participants.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Biological Invasions, Global Climate Change and Species Distribution Models: An Investigation of Species-Climate Relationships Across Space and Time</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Fitzpatrick, Matthew C.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Species distribution models are increasingly being applied to questions in ecology, biogeography and evolution, and in particular to the problem of predicting the potential spread of invasive species and the potential impacts of climatic change on biodiversity. However, despite their broad application, several conceptual limitations still preclude the use of species distribution models in many theoretical and practical applications. Chief among these is the assumption that climate alone determines the geographic ranges of species, as opposed to biotic interactions and dispersal limitations, and that such species-climate relationships remain largely unchanged across space and time. In this context, I explore the degree to which climate constrains the distributions of species and how such relationships change during biological invasions and under climate change. I first examine whether species-climate relationships are conserved during the invasion of the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) and find evidence, in contrast to model assumptions, that invasive species can undergo rapid niche shifts during invasive spread and that this result is robust to variable selection. Next, I explore the degree to which migration constraints may limit the ability of Banksia (Proteaceae) species endemic to southwestern Australia to respond to climate change. I find that migration constraints may not represent a major factor in determining future patterns of biodiversity in this region as ranges of most species were projected to collapse rather than shift and that this result was consistent across different scenarios of future climate. Finally, I investigate the relative importance of dispersal limitation (as implied by seed dispersal mode) and contemporary climate in determining of patterns of biodiversity for 2543 species of plants in southwestern Australia. In contrast to the predicted relationship, I find that the distributions of dispersal-limited species were less constrained by dispersal and more constrained by climate than the distributions of ostensibly more vagile species. Taken together, these studies suggest, in strong contrast with model assumptions, that species climate-relationships can change, sometimes rapidly, under environmental change such that future patterns of biodiversity and biological invasions may not be readily predictable from current distributions of species.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Walking in their Shoes: Parents' Journeys Through Early Childhood Special Education Transitions</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kachmarik, Lucanne Marie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this qualitative study was to gain an understanding of the experiences of parents as they transitioned their children from an early intervention program to an early childhood special education program. This study was conducted in a rural area of Virginia and participants included thirty parents from several school divisions. Four primary themes were derived through individual interviews and focus groups, and included: parents received information and services from programs; parents experienced barriers (lack of knowledge and experience with schools, differences in programs and services, communication issues among parties, dealing with own emotions, and fears for children); parents received benefits (emotional support from early intervention professionals, and developed rapport and new relationships with school personnel); and parents offered suggestions and advice for future transitions (improve communication and coordination, expand information and services for parents, advocate for “parent to parent’ networking, develop strength and coping skills, and consider options for preparing children for transitions).</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Alkoxide Routes to Inorganic Materials</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Thomas, George Harrison</dc:creator>
<dc:description>An all alkoxide solution chemistry utilizing metal 2-methoxyethoxide complexes in 2-methoxyethanol was used to deposit thin-films of metal oxides on single-crystal metal oxide substrates and on biaxially textured metal substrates. This same chemistry was used to synthesize complex metal oxide nanoparticles. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy was used to study precursor solutions of the alkaline niobates and tantalates. Film crystallization temperatures were determined from X-ray diffraction patterns of powders derived from the metal oxide precursor solutions. Film structure was determined via X-ray diffraction. Film morphology was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).
Epitaxial thin-films of strontium bismuth tantalate (SrBi2Ta2O9, SBT) and strontium bismuth niobate (SrBi2Nb2O9, SBN) were deposited on single crystal [1 0 0] magnesium oxide (MgO) buffered with lanthanum manganate (LaMnO3, LMO). Epitaxial thin films of LMO were deposited on single crystal [100] MgO via Rf-magnetron sputtering and on single crystal [100] lanthanum aluminate (LaAIO3) via the chemical solution deposition technique.
Epitaxial thin-films of sodium potassium tantalate (Na0.5K0.5TaO3, NKT), sodium potassium niobate (Na0.5K0.5NbO3, NKN) and sodium potassium tantalum niobate (Na0.5K0.5Ta.05Nb0.5O3, NKTN) were deposited on single crystal [1 0 0] lanthanum aluminate and [1 0 0] MgO substrates (NKT and NKN) and biaxially textured metal substrates via the chemical solution deposition technique. Epitaxial growth of thin-films of NKT, NKN and NKTN was observed on LAO and Ni-5% W. Epitaxial growth of thin-films of NKN and the growth of c-axis aligned thin-films of NKT was observed on MgO.
Nanoparticles of SBT, SBN, NKT and NKN were synthesized in reverse micelles from alkoxide precursor solutions. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron spectroscopy investigations reveal that amorphous nanoparticles (~5 nm) of SBT and SBN were synthesized. X-ray diffraction investigations reveal that nanoparticles (~3 nm) of NKT and NKN were also synthesized by this method.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Regulation of B cell response to respiratory viruses</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sundararajan, Aarthi</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Viruses replicating in the respiratory tract (RT) triggers a wide- range of cytokines and chemokines that have antiviral and pro-inflammatory features, instigating an efficient virus- specific B and T cell response that aids in virus- clearance. The majority of antibody secreting cells (ASCs) localizing in the upper RT secrete IgA that can effectively neutralize viruses. In addition, elements of B cell memory are generated that can provide protection from re-infection. Studies examining these aspects, following murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) infection comprise chapter 2 of the dissertation work. Our studies demonstrate that following MHV-68 infection, unlike influenza infection, resulted in a generalized deficiency of virus-specific IgA induction and deficient B cell memory establishment in the respiratory tract. The studies indicate that these aspects of B cell response are regulated by features of virus- replication in the RT. These studies lead to the speculation that these features of B cell response may represent an evolutionary adaptation of viruses that establish long-term latency and are transmitted periodically after reactivation and shedding in secretions.
Following cognate interactions with CD4+ T cells, the B cells undergo proliferation, isotype-switching and differentiate towards extrafollicular (low affinity, rapid) or germinal center pathway (high affinity). It is not clear what factors regulate these pathways of B cell differentiation, especially in the context of virus infection in the RT. Studies examining these aspects following influenza infection comprise chapter 3 of the dissertation work. Our studies establish a model for the investigation of host and viral factors that modulate the quality and effectiveness of the B cell response to influenza infection. The findings indicate that the strength of the extrafollicular B cell response depends on the nature of the infecting virus. We present evidence that this pathway of rapid antiviral antibody production relates to the production of non-specifically acting factors in the lung and also dependent of the cytokine profile of virus-specific CD4+T cells.
In summary, the current dissertation findings point out to an influence of virus and host associated factors in regulating features of B cell response in the RT.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Wind Regimes in Complex Terrain of the Great Valley of Eastern Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Birdwell, Kevin Ray</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This research was designed to provide an understanding of physical wind mechanisms within the complex terrain of the Great Valley of Eastern Tennessee to assess the impacts of regional air flow with regard to synoptic and mesoscale weather changes, wind direction shifts, and air quality.  Meteorological data from 2008–2009 were analyzed from 13 meteorological sites along with associated upper level data.  Up to 15 ancillary sites were used for reference.  Two-step complete linkage and K-means cluster analyses, synoptic weather studies, and ambient meteorological comparisons were performed to generate hourly wind classifications.  These wind regimes revealed seasonal variations of underlying physical wind mechanisms (forced channeled, vertically coupled, pressure-driven, and thermally-driven winds).  Synoptic and ambient meteorological analysis (mixing depth, pressure gradient, pressure gradient ratio, atmospheric and surface stability) suggested up to 93% accuracy for the clustered results. Probabilistic prediction schemes of wind flow and wind class change were developed through characterization of flow change data and wind class succession.
Data analysis revealed that wind flow in the Great Valley was dominated by forced channeled winds (45–67%) and vertically coupled flow (22–38%).  Down-valley pressure-driven and thermally-driven winds also played significant roles (0–17% and 2–20%, respectively), usually accompanied by convergent wind patterns (15–20%) and large wind direction shifts, especially in the Central/Upper Great Valley.  The behavior of most wind regimes was associated with detectable pressure differences between the Lower and Upper Great Valley.  Mixing depth and synoptic pressure gradients were significant contributors to wind pattern behavior.  Up to 15 wind classes and 10 sub-classes were identified in the Central Great Valley with 67 joined classes for the Great Valley at-large.  Two-thirds of Great Valley at-large flow was defined by 12 classes.  Winds flowed on-axis only 40% of the time.
The Great Smoky Mountains helped create down-valley pressure-driven winds, downslope mountain breezes, and divergent air flow.  The Cumberland Mountains and Plateau were associated with wind speed reductions in the Central Great Valley, Emory Gap Flow, weak thermally-driven winds, and northwesterly down sloping.  Ridge-and-valley terrain enhanced wind direction reversals, pressure-driven winds, as well as locally and regionally produced thermally-driven flow.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Resistance to Learning in Mandatory Training Contexts: Design and Construction of a Diagnostic Instrument</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Taylor, Jonathan E</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to design a valid and reliable instrument that contains original scales measuring learning resistance behaviors and cognitions, along with four other hypothetically related factors, resentment, disinterest, overconfidence, and perceived social norms. This process entailed constructing valid items for each of the five included scales; testing those scales for reliability using internal consistency analysis; and validating those scales using external criteria.  The multiple scales were tested for intra-correlations to support or disconfirm a series of hypotheses reflecting the hypothetical relationships between learning resistance and the other four included factors. The resultant instrument contains five reliable scales, and the Openness Scale shows a strong negative correlation with the resistance scale, providing some criterion-related validity. Very strong positive correlations exist between all included scales, which suggest the need to provide additional indicators of discriminant validity in future validation studies on this instrument.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Use of Proteomics Tools to Investigate Protein Expression in Azospirillum brasilense</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Khalsa-Moyers, Gurusahai K</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Mass spectrometry based proteomics has emerged as a powerful methodology for investigating protein expression.  “Bottom up” techniques in which proteins are first digested, and resulting peptides separated via multi-dimensional chromatography then analyzed via mass spectrometry provide a wide depth of coverage of expressed proteomes. This technique has been successfully and extensively used to survey protein expression (expression proteomics) and also to investigate proteins and their associated interacting partners in order to ascertain function of unknown proteins (functional proteomics).   Azospirillum brasilense is a free-living diazotrophic soil bacteria, with world-wide significance as a plant-growth promoting bacteria.  Living within the rhizosphere of cereal grasses, its diverse metabolism is important for its survival in the competitive rhizospheric environment.  The recently sequenced genome of strain Sp245 provided a basis for the proteome studies accomplished in this work.  After initial mass spectrometer parameter optimization studies, the expressed proteomes of two strains of Azospirillum brasilense, Sp7 and Sp245, grown under both nitrogen fixing and optimal growth (non nitrogen fixing) conditions were analyzed using a bottom up proteomics methodology.  Further proteome studies were conducted with A. brasilense strain Sp7 in order to ascertain the effect of one chemotaxis operon, termed Che1.   In this study, proteomic surveys were conducted on two bacterial derivative strains, created earlier, which lacked either a forward signaling pathway or an adaptation pathway.  The proteomic surveys conducted in this work provide a foundation for further biochemical investigations.  In order to facilitate further investigation and a movement into functional proteomics, a set of destination vectors was created that contain a variety of tandem affinity tags.  The addition of tandem affinity tags to a protein allow for generic purification schemes, and can facilitate future studies to investigate proteins of interest discovered in the first expression proteomic surveys of A. brasilense.  Taken together, this dissertation provides a valuable data set for investigation into the physiology of A. brasilense and further provides biochemical tools for analysis of the functional protein interactions of A. brasilense cells.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Impact of Transportation and Childcare Assistance on Self-Sufficiency in Families First Participants in Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Shumaker, Debra Anne Wolfe</dc:creator>
<dc:description>States are not required to provide subsidies for childcare and transportation, but at the time of this writing all provided some supplements to TANF participants who were working, looking for work, or attending school. However, there has been little assessment of the effectiveness of these programs. Using data from a longitudinal study on Families First participants in the state of Tennessee, this exploratory study addresses the questions of whether transportation and childcare supplements contribute to the ability of TANF participants to move off welfare and support their families adequately through their own efforts, and whether outcomes from these services differ by geographic location. The survey sample consisted of 3,569 respondents who were currently receiving or who had recently received TANF services through Tennessee's Families First program, beginning with the initial survey in 2001.
Regardless of any assistance provided for childcare and transportation, which have been addressed in the literature as significant barriers to employment and thus the well-being of TANF participants, most of the survey participants remain among the poorest families in the country. While transportation and childcare supports may alleviate some of the barriers that TANF participants must overcome, this research finds that they do not in themselves improve the likelihood that poor families will be abot to move out of poverty. However, there are some indicators that they do help in terms of having employment, which is the first step toward achieving financial well-being.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Coronaviral 2’-O-Methyltransferase Function in Virus Replication.</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Dziduszko, Agnieszka</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Primary and higher order RNA structures in the 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions of the genomes of positive-strand RNA viruses are known to function as cis-acting elements for genome translation and replication. Four cis-acting replication elements have been identified in the bovine coronavirus (BCoV) 3’ untranslated region that are postulated to recruit viral and cellular proteins for assembly of the replication complex and initiation of negative-strand synthesis. This study had the goal of identifying and establishing the function of the viral proteins that bind BCoV 3’ terminal cis-acting RNA structures. A major surprising discovery was a specific interaction of the BCoV-encoded 2’-O-methyltransferase (2’-O-MT), an enzyme normally involved in 5’-terminal cap methylation, with a 3’-terminal cis-acting octamerassociated bulged stem-loop. This discovery led to detailed analyses of BCoV 2’-O-MT that is summarized as follows: (i) Enzyme probing revealed the higher-order structure of the cis-acting 3’-terminal bulged stem loop. (ii) Specific binding of the 2’-O-MT to both the 5’ cap-0 structure and to the 3’-terminal bulged stem-loop was documented. (iii) Enhanced translation of a viral genomic RNA was demonstrated as a function of 2’-O-MT methylating activity. (iv) A requirement for 2’-O-MT methylating activity for virus replication was demonstrated with the use of the mouse hepatitis coronavirus reverse genetics system. (v) Over-expression of the viral 2’-O-MT in virus-infected cells had no detrimental in-trans effect on viral genome replication, transcription, or translation, but affected DI RNA accumulation in-cis. These results indicate that the coronaviral 2’-O-MT is essential for virus genome translation and replication and, as a multifunctional protein, is an attractive target for development of an anticoronaviral therapeutic drug.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Experience of Teachers Who Have Moved From Childhood Poverty to Middle Class</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Dunkin, John Steven</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to research the phenomenon of an individual who has moved from long term poverty into middle class. Phenomenological interviews were conducted with six participants who had experienced poverty in their childhood, attended and graduated college and obtained professional licenses to teach public school; these licenses gave them access to a teaching position with its commensurate middle class status and salary. Interviews began with the question, &quot;Tell me about your childhood and how you became a teacher.&quot; Data analysis revealed four themes (and subthemes) in the narratives of these six participants: (1) durable family relationships (longstanding marriages, strong emotional bonds with family members); (2) presence of encouragers (friends and family members as encouragers, teachers and other respected adults as encouragers); (3) determination to be different (proactive determination, reactive determination); and (4) school-based opportunities for meaningful participation (meaningful relationships with teachers, meaningful activities). The experiences of these participants indicate that schools that wish to support poor children and youth in achieving their life goals might consider ways to help students make positive connections with adults in the building, support the families of these students, and offer meaningful activities in addition to academic programs. Further research would be useful investigating the experiences of persons who grew up in poverty and moved into middle class in different geographic regions, through different career paths, and by moving away from their childhood communities.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>AdS/CFT Correspondence and Hydrodynamics of Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Alsup, James Ethan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The experiments performed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Lab have discovered a state of matter called the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP).  The strong coupling has limited the ability of the standard theory to describe such matter, namely Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).  However, string theory's anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence has provided a new way to study the situation and in an analytical manner.  So far, hydrodynamic properties of RHIC's plasma, such as elliptic flow and longitudinal expansion, have been seen to follow from classical supergravity calculations.  In this dissertation I discuss some of the field's development as well as the research done by the author and collaborators.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Racial and Sexual Discrimination Occurring to Korean Players on the LPGA Tour</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lim, Seung-Yup</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of Korean players on the LPGA Tour regarding issues of social justice. More specifically, this study examined how Korean players perceived their experiences of race and gender during their athletic careers in the U. S.
The participants of the study were 11 Korean professional golfers who were enrolled as members of the LPGA in 2007. The qualitative methodology of interviewing was employed which consisted of semi-structured questions within cultural studies and feminist standpoint theory. Six semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted: three group and three individual interviews. After data collection was completed, the data was analyzed using inductive analysis method to create themes.
Consequently, this study discovered that the Korean players on the LPGA Tour had negative experiences toward the treatment they received during their careers in the U.S. In regards to the experiences related to their race, Korean players believed that racial discrimination existed in the LPGA Tour. They thought that they were singled-out, and it was easy that one Korean player‟s fault became generalized as all Korean players‟ problem. In addition, Media (e.g., Golf Channel) and the LPGA were indifferent to Korean players in terms of displaying Korean players on television and at the LPGA website. Above all, Korean players were silent to the perceived racial discrimination due to their lack of fluency in English.
Regarding the experiences related to their gender, it was revealed that, as a social institution, the LPGA had played a significant role in producing traditional gender ideologies, by emphasizing female golfers‟ femininity. In addition, as a majority of the society, white male caddies as well as male Pro-Am players sexually harassed Korean players either verbally or physically. Most importantly, sexual harassment occurring to Korean players on the LPGA Tour could be considered sexual racism due to its nature that a majority group of people (white male caddies) of the society discriminated against minority women from an Asian country.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effects of 2000-2050 Global Climate Change on Ozone and Particulate Matter Air Quality in the United States Using Models-3/CMAQ System</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lam, Yun-Fat</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The Models-3/Community Multi-scale Air Quality modeling system (CMAQ), coupled with Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) atmospheric General Circulation Model (GCM), fifth Generation Mesoscale Model system (MM5), and Goddard Earth Observing System-CHEMistry (GEOS-Chem), was used to simulate atmospheric concentration of ozone and particulate matter over the continental United States 12-km and 36-km (CONUS) domains at year 2000 and year 2050.  In the study, GISS GCM model outputs interfaced with MM5 were utilized to supply the current and future meteorological conditions for CMAQ.  The conventional CMAQ profile initial and boundary conditions were replaced by time-varied and layer-varied GEOS-Chem outputs.  The future emission concentrations were estimated using year 2000 based emissions with emission projections suggested by the IPCC A1B scenario.  Multi-scenario statistical analyses were performed to investigate the effects of climate change and change of anthropogenic emissions toward 2050. The composite effects of these changes were broken down into individual effects and analyzed on three distinct regions (i.e., Midwest, Northeast and Southeast). The results of CMAQ hourly and 8-hour average concentrations indicate the maximum ozone concentration in the Midwest is increased slightly from year 2000 to year 2050, as a result of increasing average and maximum temperatures by 2 to 3 degrees Kelvin.  In converse, there is an observed reduction of surface ozone concentration in the Southeast caused by the decrease in solar radiation.  For the emission reduction scenario, the decline of anthropogenic emissions causes reductions of both ozone and PM2.5 for all regions.  The emission reduction has compensated the effect of increasing temperature.  The overall change on the maximum daily 8-hr ozone and average PM2.5 concentrations in year 2050 were estimated to be 10% and 40% less than the values in year 2000, respectively.  The modeling results indicates the effect of emissions reduction has greater impact than the effect of climate change.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Advanced Techniques in Mass Spectrometry for Qualitative and Quantitative Protein Characterization</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Dykstra, Andrew Boissy</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Though mass spectrometry has earned a central role in the field of proteomics due to its versatility in a wide range of experiments, challenges and complications are still encountered when using mass spectrometry to characterize protein structures, post-translational modifications (PTMs), and abundances.  In this dissertation, analytical methods utilizing mass spectrometry have been developed to address challenges associated with both qualitative and quantitative protein characterization.  The effectiveness of using multiple pepsin-like proteases, both separately and in mixtures, combined with online proteolysis using a special triaxial probe has been demonstrated on an amyloid beta peptide related to the onset of Alzheimer’s disease.  These findings have broad implications in protein structural characterization studies using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry.  A wider range of proteases (Lys-C, Glu-C, and trypsin) and multiple fragmentation methods (collisionally activated dissociation, electron transfer dissociation, and decision tree) have been utilized in the discovery-based PTM characterization of extracellular cellulosome proteins of the bioenergy-relevent organism Clostridium thermocellum, resulting in the identification of 85 previously unknown modification sites in 28 cellulosome proteins.  These modifications may contribute to the structure and/or function of the cellulosome protein complex.  By using peptide internal standards and a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in selected reaction monitoring mode, a method has been developed for the absolute quantitation of the Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome protein machine in samples ranging in complexity from purified cellulosome samples to whole cell lysates as an alternative to a previously-developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method of cellulosome quantitation.  The precision of the cellulosome mass concentration in technical replicates is better than 5% relative standard deviation for all samples, indicating high precision of cellulosome mass concentration for this method.  Though methods and results presented in this dissertation have implications in the study of Alzheimer’s disease and bioenergy research, more broadly this dissertation focuses on development of methods to contend with some of the more complex challenges associated with protein characterization currently presented to the field of proteomics.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Elucidating the Growth Mechanisms of Electron Beam Induced Deposition via a Three Dimensional, Monte-Carlo Based Simulation</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Smith, Daryl Allen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The rapid and precise direct-write growth of nanoscale features by electron-beaminduced deposition (EBID) and etching (EBIE) requires the optimization of the growth parameters to maintain nanoscale feature dimensions. The tremendous and complex EBID parameter space includes the precursor gas pressure, the primary electron beam energy, the electron beam current, surface diffusion rates of adsorbed precursor species, thermal effects on desorption, and the cascade of electron species produced by elastic and inelastic scattering processes. These variables determine the feature growth velocity and the size of the structure through a series of complex, coupled nonlinear interactions. A dynamic computer simulation based on Monte-Carlo calculation sequences was created to aide in the interpretation of experimental observations by simulating experimental EBID growth conditions for a nanoscale stationary and scanned electron beam with properties characteristic of a conventional SEM.
In this dissertation, initially the Monte Carlo EBID simulation details are presented. Subsequently, four specific case studies are simulated. The details of the mechanisms and electron types responsible for vertical and lateral growth are presented. Initially, EBID growth was compared in a reaction rate limited regime at different beam energies (1keV versus 5keV). This yielded lower growth rates at higher energy due to a combination of variables, including a lower dissociation cross section and a decreased secondary electron coefficient. Second, reaction rate versus mass transport limited growth of tungsten from a WF6 precursor was studied, and the lateral broadening associated with mass transport limited growth was elucidated. Third, a study was performed to determine the effects of precursor surface diffusion on pillar growth rates and morphology. The changes were attributed to a shift in the otherwise mass transport limited growth with no surface diffusion to a pseudo reaction rate limited growth when the surface diffusion coefficient was sufficiently high. Fourth, two different materials were simulated and compared: tungsten from WF6, and SiO2 from Si(OC2H5)4. The different growth rates and pillar morphology correlated to the different dissociation cross sections, secondary electron yields, and the electron range, respectively.
Sample applications of the simulation are provided, including rastered depositions, via filling, and duplication of “volcano-like” structures.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Methods for the Self-Consistent Determination of Thermophysical Properties from Two-Phase Molecular Dynamics Simulations</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Fern, Jared T</dc:creator>
<dc:description>There are many tools available to measure the thermophysical properties of compounds. Experimental measurements have been evolving for many years and are very accurate at determining the properties of most compounds. However, many of the measurements are unreliable when the compound of interest is thermally unstable.
Throughout the years molecular simulation techniques have been developed to understand the thermophysical properties of thermally unstable compounds. There are primarily two methods to study Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium by molecular simulation Gibbs Ensemble Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics. MD is a technique that allows one to simulate the vapor and the liquid in the same simulation cell. The advantage to having the vapor and liquid in the same simulation cell is that an interface forms and properties not available by GEMC can be investigated. However, the inclusion of the interface complicates the determination of the phase densities.
There are two methods available in the literature to determine the phase densities from a two-phase MD simulation. The first utilizes a hyperbolic tangent function to fit the density profile across the axis normal to the interface. The second method calculates the average of a local property spatially and then determines the resulting distribution function. The distribution function is used to determine the phases from user defined phase cut-offs. These methods only work well far from the critical point and have many adjustable parameters. These adjustable parameters make it difficult to reliably obtain accurate results.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Essays on Timing of Firm Actions in Industrial Economics</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Li, Youping</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The timing of actions by firms plays an important role in industrial economics. It is key to strategic advantage in oligopoly models whether firms compete on quantity or on price. In a vertical relationship between input suppliers and final-good manufacturers, a firm which chooses a strategy first will take into account the response by those firms moving second and different sequence of play leads to different market outcomes. In my dissertation, I study the determinants and implications of the timing of firm actions in a variety of scenarios. In my first two essays, I examine how market leadership may arise endogenously in oligopoly models and focus on the effect of information about uncertain market demand. My first essay studies a quantity game and I identify the circumstance under which a perishable information asymmetry regarding stochastic demand causes market leadership. In an information acquisition game, I show that Stackelberg equilibrium in the full game is supported only when firms have different costs of information. My second essay considers a duopoly in which firms supply a differentiated product and compete on price. I find that different equilibrium outcomes arise under different information structures. Under asymmetric information, a firm’s information advantage leads to a strategic disadvantage of leading in the price game. The time value of information may well be negative, contrasting with results in the first essay. In my third essay, I consider a vertical relationship in which a supplier sets the price of an input and the firm that produces the final good must choose how much to invest in some complementary input or process. Two models with different sequence of firm actions are studied and yield different pricing strategies for the upstream monopolist. Interestingly, a change of the sequence from one model (the upstream firm commits to input prices first) to the other (the upstream firm sets input prices after investments are made) benefits all parties including the upstream monopolist, the downstream firms and the consumers.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Endocytic trafficking is required for neuron cell death through regulating TGF-beta signaling in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wang, Zixing</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Programmed cell death (PCD) is an essential feature during the development of the central nervous system in Drosophila as well as in mammals.  During metamorphosis, a group of peptidergic neurons (vCrz) are eliminated from the larval central nervous system (CNS) via PCD within 6-7 h after puparium formation.  To better understand this process, we first characterized the development of the vCrz neurons including their lineages and birth windows using the MARCM (Mosaic Analysis with a Repressible Cell Marker) assay.  Further genetic and MARCM analyses showed that not only Myoglianin (Myo) and its type I receptor Baboon is required for neuron cell death, but also this death signal is extensively regulated by endocytic trafficking in Drosophila melanogaster.  We found that clathrin-mediated membrane receptor internalization and subsequent endocytic events involved in Rab5-dependent early endosome and Rab11-dependent recycling endosome differentially participate in TGF-β [beta] signaling.  Two early endosome-enriched proteins, SARA and Hrs, are found to act as a cytosolic retention factor of Smad2, indicating that endocytosis mediates TGF-β [beta] signaling through regulating the dissociation of Smad2 and its cytosolic retention factor.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Determinants of Supreme Court Decision-Making: An Ideal Point Analysis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Glennon, Colin Ross</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The relationships among governmental institutions are some of the most studied phenomena in political science. Yet these complex interactions remain largely unexplained due to the difficult task of developing accurate measures that lead to quantifiable tests that enhance explanation and prediction. This work centers on the interactions of United States Supreme Court justices with other political actors. The goal of this dissertation is to better understand the relationship between the Supreme Court and its institutional environment. In short, I ask: What factors affect Supreme Court justices’ voting decisions?
I approach this question from several different angles while making use of a unique dependent variable—Yearly Supreme Court justice ideal point. This variable is a variant of the ideal points calculated by Michael A. Bailey of Georgetown University (Bailey, 2007). My empirical models consider the effects of numerous independent variables on this dependent variable. One of the unique aspects of this study is that it considers the effects of a wide variety of factors purported to affect judicial behavior. There are four main theories of judicial decision-making, and my empirical analyses test notions exported from all of them. In designing and testing my models, I draw especially on the developing approach of new institutionalism—an approach to the study of judicial politics that emphasizes the influence of external, non-judicial political actors on judicial behavior. Ultimately this work will show what factors constrain the actions of Supreme Court justices and to what degree they do so. This research has many implications for larger theoretical concerns of political science, specifically formulating questions about the independence of the judiciary and contains relevant questions for democratic theory as well.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Systems, Social Order, and the Global Debt Crisis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bradford, John Hamilton</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Part I examines the global rise of both public and private debt and its recent manifestations in the US housing bubble and the financial panic of 2007-8.  A review of the most popular theories of the debt crisis is provided, including an explication of securitized banking and economic theory.  The underlying condition of increasing ecological and energetic scarcity is accorded central significance in the broad trajectory of world growth and debt,    Part II explicates systems theories of social order and the social significance of markets.  The theories of Niklas Luhmann, Talcott Parsons, Mario Bunge, Anthony Giddens, and Jürgen Habermas are evaluated with respect to their theories of social order and crisis.  A central finding is that, although declining rates of exergy production inhibit the global economic recovery as measured by conventional economic tools, this fact is not likely to be widely recognized.  A central theme of Part II is how social systems handle uncertainty, risk, and to what extent complex social systems can be regulated normatively by the public sphere.  As global society becomes increasingly interconnected and dependent upon the depletion of material and energy resources, the communication channels that facilitate the self-understanding of modern society at the same time proliferate, becoming increasingly disconnected and self-referential.  Luhmann’s systems theory is used to explain why collective recognition and action is at once rendered more necessary and increasingly unlikely given the complexity of global society that Earth’s terrestrial stock of nonrenewable energy resources has engendered.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Discursive Construction of Autism: Contingent Meanings of Autism and Therapeutic Talk</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lester, Jessica Nina</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This dissertation was a discourse analysis study, drawing upon discursive psychology, poststructural understandings of discourse, conversation analysis, and a social relational model of disability.  The purpose of this study was to explore how autism was performed as an interactional event among children with autism labels, the therapists who work with them, and their parents, in the context of a pediatric therapy setting.  I interrogated how the participants’ everyday discursive practices were shaped and, at times, constrained by the social and political institutions that often work to define autism and the related, official plans of treatment.  A total of 12 families agreed to participate, resulting in the participation of 12 children with autism labels, three to 11 years of age, six fathers, and 11 mothers.  The participants included three speech therapists, two occupational therapists, one physical therapist, one teacher/social group facilitator, and one medical secretary/sibling support group facilitator.  Data sources included conversational data from the therapy sessions of the participating children and their therapists, 14 parent interviews, eight therapist interviews, documents used within the therapy sessions, demographic surveys/information from the participating therapists and parents, and two interviews with a state advocate and clinical directors focused on qualifying for services.  Findings from the interview data highlighted the varied meanings and performances of autism, while pointing to the related political and social conditions that make the naming and treating of autism (im)possible.  Findings drawn from the therapy session data pointed to how the participants’ discursive practices worked to reframe “behaviors of concern,” and to transgress normative communication patterns.  The following conclusions were drawn from the findings: (a) autism, as a construct, remains open to multiple meanings, while being inextricably linked to institutionalized practices; (b) in therapy talk, therapists and children with autism labels often co-construct alternative accounts of problematic behaviors; and (c) therapy talk can function to reframe non-normative communication and behavioral patterns, expanding what is constructed as “acceptable.”  The findings point to the complexities of defining and performing autism labels, and highlight the ways in which therapy talk can function to reframe behaviors and communication patterns presumed to be pathological.</dc:description>

Teleoperated task execution for hazardous environments is slow and requires highly skilled operators. Attempts to implement telerobotic assists to improve efficiency have been demonstrated in constrained laboratory environments but are not being used in the field because they are not appropriate for use on actual remote systems operating in complex unstructured environments using typical operators. This work describes a methodology for combining select concepts from behavior-based systems with telerobotic tool control in a way that is compatible with existing manipulator architectures used by remote systems typical to operations in hazardous environment. The purpose of the approach is to minimize the task instance modeling in favor of a priori task type models while using sensor information to register the task type model to the task instance. The concept was demonstrated for two tools useful to decontamination &amp; dismantlement type operations—a reciprocating saw and a powered socket tool. The experimental results demonstrated that the approach works to facilitate traded control telerobotic tooling execution by enabling difficult tasks and by limiting tool damage. The role of the tools and tasks as drivers to the telerobotic implementation was better understood in the need for thorough task decomposition and the discovery and examination of the tool process signature. The contributions of this work include: (1) the exploration and evaluation of select features of behavior-based robotics to create a new methodology for integrating telerobotic tool control with positional teleoperation in the execution of complex tool-centric remote tasks, (2) the simplification of task decomposition and the implementation of sensor-based tool control in such a way that eliminates the need for the creation of a task instance model for telerobotic task execution, and (3) the discovery, demonstrated use, and documentation of characteristic tool process signatures that have general value in the investigation of other tool control, tool maintenance, and tool development strategies above and beyond the benefit sustained for the methodology described in this work.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Impact of Role Conceptualization on the Process and Outcomes of Decision Making in an Educational Context</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Turner, Scott Richard</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Research has shown that the traditional conceptualization of Organizational Citizenship Behaviors (OCBs) is not tenable because some employees perceive OCBs to be part of their job or in-role behaviors (Morrison, 1994). Conceptualizing behaviors as in-role has been shown to increase the frequency of the behaviors but no study has investigated whether conceptualization of these behaviors influences the manner in which they are conducted. This study combined findings from OCB research with the Judgment and Decision Making literature in order to identify the impact that role conceptualization had on an ambiguous decision making exercise where the act of making the decision could have been considered an OCB. It was hypothesized that role conceptualization would influence the decision-making process used and outcomes associated with the decision. This influence was hypothesized to result in decisions that are more systematic if participants perceived the task as part of their job. Additionally, it was hypothesized that personal characteristics or work context would influence decisions and that effect would be moderated by role conceptualization. Results indicate that role conceptualization was not significantly related to the use of relevant student characteristics. Teachers who considered the decision-making task as an important part of their jobs were actually less consistent in their decisions to recommend college. Finally, while there was evidence that personal and work characteristics influenced the decision outcomes and processes, there was no support for the moderating effects of role conceptualization.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Sword, the Purse and the Gavel: Institutional Influences on the Behavior of Supreme Court Justices</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sharma, Hemant</dc:creator>
<dc:description>An inherent contradiction exists between two fundamental principles embedded in American political philosophy: the notion of &quot;checks and balances&quot; and the idea of an &quot;independent judiciary.&quot; After all, a truly &quot;independent&quot; branch of government would be immune to the influences, or &quot;checks,&quot; of external institutions. This dissertation addresses that juxtaposition through a two part analysis of Supreme Court decision-making.
The first part uses multivariate regression to illustrate that justices confirmed under conditions of divided government are more moderate in their voting behavior than justices confirmed under conditions of unified government. Ancillary findings also reveal that justices who receive more votes during their Senate confirmation hearings will be more moderate in their voting behavior and that justices appointed by presidents with higher Gallup Approval Ratings tend to be more &quot;extreme&quot; in their voting behavior. Overall, the confirmation process appears to offer an avenue through which the executive and legislative branches can &quot;check and balance&quot; the voting outputs of the Supreme Court.
The second part of this dissertation assesses the degree to which justices remain independent from the influences of the &quot;political&quot; branches once they begin serving on the Court. Time series regression models indicate that Supreme Court justices are likely to vary their voting behavior in civil rights and civil liberties cases based on which party controls the White House at the time a vote is being cast. Evidence also shows that justices are likely to vary their voting behavior in economic cases based on which party is strongest in Congress. Beyond that, findings also suggest that justices exhibit differences in voting behavior while the appointing president is in office, and, surprisingly, that justices seem to grow more liberal in their voting behavior over time. Collectively, this information indicates that there are certain situations (such as case issues or time periods in a justice‘s tenure) in which Supreme Court justices are not entirely &quot;independent&quot; in their behavior. For those who cherish the ideal of judicial independence, this may be a deleterious development; conversely, for those who deride the expansive role that the Supreme Court may have taken in contemporary society, the implication of a link between democratic processes and voting outputs may be a sanguine pronouncement.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Novel Frequency Based Current-to-Digital Converter with Programmable Dynamic Range</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Yu, Xiaoyan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This work describes a novel frequency based Current to Digital converter, which would be fully realizable on a single chip.
Biological systems make use of delay line techniques to compute many things critical to the life of an animal. Seeking to build up such a system, we are adapting the auditory localization circuit found in barn owls to detect and compute the magnitude of an input current.
The increasing drive to produce ultra low-power circuits necessitates the use of very small currents. Frequently these currents need to accurately measured, but current solutions typically involve off-chip measurements. These are usually slow, and moving a current off chip increases noise to the system. Moving a system such as this completely on chip will allow for precise measurement and control of bias currents, and it will allow for better compensation of some common transistor mismatch issues.
This project affords an extremely low power (100s nW) converter technology that is also very space efficient. The converter is completely asynchronous which yields ultra-low power standby operation [1].</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Studies on the mechanism of homolog pairing in Drosophila male meiosis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Tsai, Jui-He</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Drosophila male is an example of achiasmatic meiosis which lacks crossingover and chiasmata during meiosis.  Previous studies showed that homologous pairing of both euchromatin and centromeres is lost during middle prophase I, however, homologs are still connected as they form bivalents.  The X-Y pair utilizes a specific repeated sequence within the heterochromatic ribosomal DNA blocks as a pairing site.  No pairing sites have yet been identified for the autosomes.  To search for such sites, we utilized probes specifically targeting heterochromatin regions to assay pairing sequences and behavior in meiosis by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).  We found that the fourth homologs pair at the heterochromatic region 61 and associate with the X chromosome throughout prophase I.  The pairing of the fourth homologs is disrupted in the homolog conjunction complex mutants.  Conversely, six tested heterochromatic regions of the major autosomes (second and third chromosomes) have proved to be largely unpaired after early prophase I.  This suggests that pairing mechanism of the major autosomes may differ from the sex and fourth chromosomes; stable connections between major autosomal homologs might occur at different sites along chromosomes in different cells by analogy to chiasmata.  Moreover, FISH analysis also revealed two distinct patterns of sister chromatid cohesion in heterochromatin: regions with stable cohesion and regions lacking cohesion, suggesting that sister chromatid cohesion is incomplete within heterochromatin but with preferential sites in male meiosis.Modifier of Mdg4 in Meiosis (MNM) and Stromalin in Meiosis (SNM) are components of homolog conjunction complex and essential for homolog pairing and segregation in male meiosis.  Using yeast two-hybrid assay and co-immunoprecipitation, we showed that the MNM and SNM interact with each other.  Specifically, the BTB domain of MNM is responsible for the interaction with SNM, whereas FLYWCH domain of MNM is crucial for this interaction but does not directly interact with SNM.  Additionally, point mutation analysis revealed that L9K replacement of the BTB domain weakened the MNM-SNM interaction and caused high frequencies of chromosome nondisjunction.  In conclusion, these results provide a biochemical basis for the mechanism of homolog pairing and support the role of homolog conjunction complex in male meiosis.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>On the homology of automorphism groups of free groups.</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Gray, Jonathan Nathan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Following the work of Conant and Vogtmann on determining the homology of the group of outer automorphisms of a free group, a new nontrivial class in the rational homology of Outer space is established for the free group of rank eight. The methods started in [8] are heavily exploited and used to create a new graph complex called the space of good chord diagrams. This complex carries with it significant computational advantages in determining possible nontrivial homology classes.Next, we create a basepointed version of the Lie operad and explore some of it proper- ties. In particular, we prove a Kontsevich-type theorem that relates the Lie homology of a particular space to the cohomology of the group of automorphisms of the free group.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Malignant Catarrhal Fever Viruses in Tennessee Ruminants</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Cissell, Robin Lynn</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) is a lymphoproliferative and inflammatory syndrome affecting primarily ruminant species.  The disease, which is often fatal, is most often described as affecting bovids and cervids.  No vaccines are available for prevention of MCFV infection.  The primary method to control spread of disease is to prevent contact between carriers and clinically susceptible species.  There is no known method to control infection of malignant catarrhal fever virus-white-tailed deer variant (MCFV-WTD), as the carrier animal of this virus is unknown.
To determine the prevalence of malignant catarrhal fever viruses in Tennessee ruminant populations, blood and/or lymph node samples were collected from farms, animal processing and disposal facilities, and hunter check-in stations from 2006-2008 from several species of animals including cervids, cattle, and goats.  Strain-specific real time PCR was developed to detect ovine herpesvirus-2 (OvHV-2), caprine herpesvirus-2 (CpHV-2), and MCFV-WTD DNA.  MCFV DNA was detected in all species of ruminants sampled.  Although disease related to infection with MCFV-WTD and CpHV-2 has not been reported in Tennessee cattle or cervid populations, MCFV-WTD DNA was detected in 3 percent of cervid samples, and MCFV-WTD and CpHV-2 DNA was detected in 27 and 3 percent respectively of cattle samples from animal disposal facilities that process dead or debilitated animals. One hunter harvested deer (n=781) and 25 cattle (n=165) tested from animal disposal facilities were positive for OvHV-2 DNA.
This study demonstrated that healthy cattle and cervids can be infected with OvHV-2 and MCFV-WTD without apparent disease, and dead or debilitated cattle were infected with OvHV-2, MCFV-WTD and CpHV-2 at a higher percentage than healthy herd animals.  Prevalence of CpHV-2 in Tennessee goat populations (7%) was significantly lower than reported in other goat populations (73%).  Low prevalence of CpHV-2 in Tennessee goat populations likely explains why no evidence of infection was found in cervids tested, and the low prevalence of CpHV-2 infection in dead or debilitated cattle compared to prevalence of infection with OvHV-2 and MCFV-WTD.  The discovery of infection in cattle with CpHV-2 and MCFV-WTD opens a new avenue of investigation into the pathology and virulence of MCFV’s in domestic cattle.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Modeling of AlGaN/GaN High Electron Mobility Transistor for Sensors and High-Temperature Circuit Applications</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Eliza, Sazia Afreen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>With the most advanced and mature technology for electronic devices, silicon (Si) based devices can be processed with practically no material defects. However, Si technology has difficulty meeting the demand for some high-power, high-speed, and high-temperature applications due to limitations in its intrinsic properties. Wide bandgap semiconductors have greater prospects compared to Si based devices. The wide band gap material system shows higher breakdown voltage, lower leakage, higher saturation velocity, larger thermal conductivity and better thermal stability suitable for high-power, high-speed, and high-temperature operations of the devices. In recent years, GaN based devices have drawn much research attention due to their superior performances compared to other wide bandgap semiconductor (SiC) devices. Specifically, implementation of AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) based power amplifiers have become very promising for applications in base stations or radar. With the increase in device power, channel temperature rises. This introduces high-temperature effects in the device characteristics. In addition, high-power, high-frequency and high-temperature operation of AlGaN/GaN HEMT is required for telemetry in extreme environment.
AlGaN/GaN HEMT also shows great potential as chemically selective field-effect transistor (CHEMFET). Due to simpler imprint technique and amplification advantages CHEMFET based detection and characterization of bio-molecules has become very popular. AlGaN/GaN HEMT has high mobility two-dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) at the hetero-interface closer to the surface and hence it shows high sensitivity to any surface charge conditions.
The primary objective of this research is to develop a temperature dependent physics based model of AlGaN/GaN HEMT to predict the performance for high-power and high- speed applications at varying temperatures. The physics based model has also been applied to predict the characteristics of AlGaN/GaN HEMT based CHEMFET for the characterization of bio-molecular solar batteries - Photosystem I reaction centers. Using the CHEMFET model, the number of reaction centers with effective orientation on the gate surface of the HEMT can be estimated.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An Investigation of the Transferability of Trip Generation Models and the Utilization of aSpatial Context Variable</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Everett, Jerry Don</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The cost of collecting data for travel demand modeling is high and increasing each year. Data collection costs could easily exceed the annual budget of a metropolitan planning organization (MPO) in small or medium-sized area. Many of these agencies borrow or transfer data and/or models from other areas since they cannot afford the cost of collecting local data. This study included two primary research objectives. The first was to test the appropriateness of transferring commonly used trip generation models from one urban area to another under specific circumstances. The second was to improve the transferability of models by including a variable reflecting the spatial context of households, the basic unit of trip generation used in most MPO models. The data utilized for this research were drawn from four separate travel surveys and included data for 11 metropolitan planning areas in two states.
The key finding of this research was that a meaningful consistent measure of spatial context can be included in trip generation models, and it can make these models more generic and transferable. This finding that the transferability of trip production models can be improved by including an additional variable called “Area Type” should be helpful to many MPOs, which have to borrow models or survey data from other areas. The data needed for developing this variable should not pose any difficulty since it is based on population data, which is readily available from the US Census Bureau. Further, the algorithm needed to stratify grid cells and the households located in them into different categories of Area Type is available in many geographic information system software packages including TransCAD, which is widely used by MPOs of all sizes.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Comparison of Four Frameworks of Teacher Leadership for Model Fit</dc:title>
<dc:creator>DeHart, Corey Alan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Research has shown that effective school leadership has a positive influence on school effectiveness and student achievement.  Current reform efforts include teachers, both formally and informally, as leaders of schools.  However, there are currently no widely-accepted measurements or models to assess both formal and informal teacher leadership in schools.  The purpose of this study was to compare model fit for the four-factor model of teacher leadership to model fit for three alternative models.  The four-factor model was developed during the second administration of the Teacher Leadership Inventory (TLI), and the three alternative models were developed from the results and recommendations from the confirmatory factor analysis of that administration.  Teacher responses to the second administration of the TLI constituted the data set for this study.  Participants included 421 teachers from 23 schools in three East Tennessee school districts.  Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted for each of the measurement models under investigation, and model fit indices and parameter estimates of all four models were used for comparison.  Model fit indices indicate better model fit for the four-factor model over both the two-factor and five-factor models but not over the three-factor model.  However, further evaluation of both parameter estimates and prior research provide support for the acceptability of the four-factor model over the three-factor model.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Roles of Non-thermal Plasma in Gas-phase Glycerol Dehydration Catalyzed by Supported Silicotungstic Acid</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Liu, Lu</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Acrolein is an indispensable chemical intermediate with a rising demand in recent years. The concern of the increase of propylene prices due to the shrinking supply of nonrenewable crude oil makes the acid-catalyzed gas-phase glycerol dehydration to acrolein a prime candidate for research. Our analysis showed that the sustainable acrolein production from glycerol was both technically and economically viable. Alumina2700® (Al) and Silica1252® (Si) loaded with silicotungstic acid (HSiW) possessed distinct features while provided equally good acrolein yield (73.86mol% and 74.05mol%, respectively) optimally.
Due to the unique non-equilibrium characteristics, non-thermal plasma (NTP) could promote a variety of chemical reactions; however, its application in a dehydration process remained blank. This study used the reaction of glycerol dehydration to acrolein to probe whether NTP could 1) improve acrolein yield during dehydration, 2) suppress the coke formation and regenerate the catalyst, and 3) modify the properties of the catalyst. 
The dielectric barrier discharge configuration was used to generate NTP; various NTP field strengths and also their interaction with temperature and the catalyst were investigated. The results showed that NTP improved the glycerol conversion and that NTP with a proper field strength increased acrolein selectivity. The optimal acrolein yields of 83.6 mol% and 83.1 mol% were achieved with 3.78 kV/cm NTP and 4.58 kV/cm NTP at 275°C for HSiW-Al and HSiW-Si, respectively.  
The application of NTP-O2 (5% oxygen in argon, 4.58 kV/cm) during glycerol dehydration significantly suppressed coke formation on HSiW-Si. NTP-O2 could regenerate the deactivated HSiW-Si at low temperatures by removing both soft and hard coke at various rates. NTP-O2 with higher field strength, at medium operation temperature (150ºC) and in argon atmosphere was more effective for coke removal/catalyst regeneration.
Applying NTP to the catalyst fabrication showed some capabilities in modifying catalyst properties, including enlarging surface area, preserving mesopores, increasing acid strength and Brønsted acidity. NTP with argon as the discharge gas performed better in these modifications than NTP with air as the discharge gas.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Long Range Automated Persistent Surveillance</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Yao, Yi</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This dissertation addresses long range automated persistent surveillance with focus on three topics: sensor planning, size preserving tracking, and high magnification imaging.
field of view should be reserved so that camera handoff can be executed successfully before the object of interest becomes unidentifiable or untraceable. We design a sensor planning algorithm that not only maximizes coverage but also ensures uniform and sufficient overlapped camera’s field of view for an optimal handoff success rate. This algorithm works for environments with multiple dynamic targets using different types of cameras. Significantly improved handoff success rates are illustrated via experiments using floor plans of various scales.
Size preserving tracking automatically adjusts the camera’s zoom for a consistent view of the object of interest. Target scale estimation is carried out based on the paraperspective projection model which compensates for the center offset and considers system latency and tracking errors. A computationally efficient foreground segmentation strategy, 3D affine shapes, is proposed. The 3D affine shapes feature direct and real-time implementation and improved flexibility in accommodating the target’s 3D motion, including off-plane rotations. The effectiveness of the scale estimation and foreground segmentation algorithms is validated via both offline and real-time tracking of pedestrians at various resolution levels.
Face image quality assessment and enhancement compensate for the performance degradations in face recognition rates caused by high system magnifications and long observation distances. A class of adaptive sharpness measures is proposed to evaluate and predict this degradation. A wavelet based enhancement algorithm with automated frame selection is developed and proves efficient by a considerably elevated face recognition rate for severely blurred long range face images.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Geomorphic Adjustment in Channelized Tributary Streams of the Lower Hatchie River Basin, West Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Boulton, Mary A</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The processes involved in fluvial geomorphic adjustment to human-induced change are not well understood, despite an increasing and global prevalence of human disturbance to rivers. This doctoral dissertation research examines spatial and temporal patterns of geomorphic adjustment processes in three tributary streams of the Lower Hatchie River Basin, in west Tennessee, which are adjusting to historic land clearance and channelization. This dissertation examines (1) the types and spatial pattern of geomorphic adjustment processes in a total of 34 tributary reaches located in Richland, Jeffers, and Dry Creeks, (2) the applicability of an existing model of geomorphic adjustment for use in tributary streams with multiple episodes of disturbance, (3) sediment dynamics at the reach scale, including floodplain and channel re-coupling, and (4) the connections between reach-scale processes of sediment dynamics and systemwide geomorphic response.  Results from this dissertation research suggest that after an initial period of down cutting, channel widening involving bank failure and bank undercutting are the dominant adjustment mechanisms, and create asymmetrically-shaped channels. Bank failures in the study tributaries are common and are produced by progressive bank undercutting related to redirection of flow towards banks by well-developed bars and berms deposited in the channel. The lifetime of channel bars and berms appears to be long, enduring beyond seven months of monitoring. The common occurrence of asymmetric channels and well-developed bar and berm deposits throughout each of the three study tributaries lends field-based support for the operation of bar-bend processes of lateral migration. These results highlight the important role of lateral adjustment processes postchannelization and sediment storage in determining the location of geomorphic processes and potentially initiating system-wide lateral migration. Applicability of the Channel Evolution Model may be liInited in tributary streams with mUltiple periods and/or locations ofchannelization because it focuses on the area of maximum disturbance, and it lacks explicit incorporation of lateral migration processes and sediment dynamics.  Field-based sediment monitoring and simulation of sediment connectivity using channel morphometrics and Multi-Response Permutation Procedure suggest that sediment dynamics remain in a state of adjustment, lacking suitable long-term storage of sediment due to floodplain/channel de-coupling and irregular sediment transport. Analysis of a core taken from one re-coupled floodplain in Richland Creek suggests that re-coupling is possible but, in this instance, required more than 50 years to occur. This indicates that sediment will continue to be stored in the channel well into the future, potentially prolonging channel widening and lateral migration processes. Finally, results from this research suggest that spatial and temporal patterns of geomorphic adjustment depend upon reach-scale processes of sediment dynamics and flow deflection. The dominance of reach-scale dynamics in the tributaries calls into question the applicability of numerical models developed on a watershed-based approach and demonstrates the need to understand reach-scale controls ofsystem-wide response in fluvial systems.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Spatially Resolved Laser and Thermal Desorption/Ionization Coupled with Mass Spectrometry</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ovchinnikova, Olga Sergeevna</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The work discussed in this dissertation is aimed at creating novel approaches to chemical imaging that ultimately allow for submicron resolution.  This goal has been approached from two direction using laser based desorption and coupling it with an AFM using apertureless tip-enhanced laser ablation/ionization. The second direction was through the development a new approach to thermal desorption based mass spectrometry experiments by using a proximal probe to spatially desorb the surface and ionizing the plume of neutrals using a secondary ionization source at atmospheric pressure. The thermal desorption approach allows for the easy scaling of the technique all the way from the millimeter to the nanometer regime. In the nanometer regime an AFM platform with silicon based heating AFM probes is used to locally desorb material from nanometer sized craters. The final work in this thesis focused on trying to improve laser based desorption through a secondary ionization of the neutrals plume by capturing the laser desorption plume into a liquid and then electrospaying the solution into a MS. The added benefit of being able to capture the desorption plume into a liquid is the ability to carry out post sampling processing of the captured analyte via high performance liquid chromatography. The ability to clean up a sample via HPLC also allow for the detection of isobaric compounds as well as trace level materials which otherwise would be obscured by matrix effects in complicated sample matrixes like tissues. This application of laser desorption with a secondary ionization by capture into a liquid could be envisioned to be applied to AFM based laser desorption techniques where boosting the ionization efficiency is crucial for signal detection.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Elementary and secondary science teachers negotiation of controversial science content: The relationships among prior conception appropriation, thinking disposition, and learning about geologic time</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Roberson, James Harold</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A major component of the values people place on science and their attitude toward it is their openness to new ideas or overall open-mindedness.  An individual’s values and attitudes become integrally connected to their prior knowledge and conceptions regarding science and science content.  Sometimes the nature of a natural phenomenon and the scientific explanation for the phenomenon is controversial.  A controversial scientific concept is one that evokes emotion and forces individuals to assess the values associated with this content and make assessments of their attitudes toward it.  This is especially true during learning.  The purpose of this study was to provide evidence on how prior knowledge and existing conceptions are related to open-mindedness when learning science content that is regarded as controversial. The participants for this study consisted of 7 elementary science teachers and 8 secondary science teachers.  Data collected for the study included the determination of how individuals assessed and used their prior/existing conceptions when learning controversial science content based on individual interviews, an individual’s level of open-mindedness as measured by the Actively Open-minded Thinking scale (AOT) and determined through the interviews, and the assessment of the change in an individual’s level of knowledge regarding geologic time as measured by the Geoscience Concept Inventory (GCI). The investigation consisted of multiple case studies analyzed within cases and across cases.  The teachers’ use of their prior conceptions was determined through the coding of interviews based on the four appropriation modes of Integration, Differentiation, Exchange, and Bridging.  Results from the interview data showed that 53% of the teachers differentiated their existing conceptions from new geologic time conceptions, while 47% integrated new conceptions with their prior conceptions.  In addition, 40% of the teachers exhibited a bimodal appropriation of their existing conceptions.  Bridging and exchange were the secondary appropriation modes observed among bimodal appropriators.  No relationships were found between the teachers’ thinking disposition (open-mindedness) and their level of geologic time knowledge, nor where there any relationships found between the teachers’ prior conception appropriation and their geologic time knowledge or their appropriation and thinking disposition.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Science and the Spirit of the Age: Blake, Wordsworth, and the Romantic Scientific Paradigm</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Call, Thomas C.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The reaction of the first wave of English Romantic poets to the Enlightenment scientific establishment is by this point well understood. As Blake once noted, &quot;All that is Valuable in Knowledge is / Superior to Demonstrative Science such as is Weighed or Measured,&quot; a view subsequently echoed by Wordsworth: &quot;How insecure, how baseless in itself, / Is the Philosophy whose sway depends / On mere material instruments.&quot; Not quite so clear, however, is the relation between these pre-eminent Romantic poets and the Romantic scientific paradigm emerging at the turn of the nineteenth century.
Both in its mainstream version, which would become modern scientific praxis, and in its most extreme variant, the Naturphilosophie of Schelling, Oken, et al., Romantic science differed from its Enlightenment predecessor by positing organic metaphors over mechanical ones, a conception of nature as process rather than product, and a historicist rather than ahistorical view of the universe. Given this orientation, a question emerges: Why did the first wave of English Romantic poets, Blake and Wordsworth particularly, fail to embrace the new Romantic science as an alternative to Enlightenment science when so many of its aspects seemed to harmonize with their personal politics and sense of aesthetics-at least, as these beliefs are articulated in their works? Why, in fact, does it appear that they pointedly rejected it?
Romantic science resonated with the &quot;Spirit of the Age,&quot; but within its view of a dynamic, evolving, and boundless universe-and the redefinition of materialism that this view engendered-were philosophical propositions even more dangerous to these poets than those within its Enlightenment counterpart. What is more, there is reason to believe that these poets had a clear sense, arrived at by the differing philosophic approaches that defined them, where this particular scientific revolution might be headed in the century to come-toward the production of a culture wherein science would be irrevocably dominant, spiritual endeavors discredited, and poetry marginalized.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Capturing Pre-evacuation Trips and Associative Delays: A Case Study of the Evacuation of Key West, Florida for Hurricane Wilma</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Noltenius, Melany Strike</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The time it takes for the residents to evacuate an area is calculated as an evacuation time estimate (ETE). In theory, these time estimates are calculated based on a number of inputs, including clearance time, the impact of traffic management techniques, and the time for the public to prepare to evacuate (Dow, 2000). Evacuation models can calculate clearance times, as well as incorporate the temporal impact of traffic management techniques, like contra-flow traffic. However, these models do not include delays associated with pre-evacuation trips. Because these trips are not well represented in hurricane evacuation models, the evacuation time estimate may be miscalculated (Wilmot and Mei, 2004).
In order to capture pre-evacuation trip behavior, an online survey of residents’ responses to the evacuation order associated with Hurricane Wilma in 2005 was conducted. Survey data gathered from the residents of Key West, Florida indicate seven important aspects of preevacuation trip making behavior: (1) Socio-demographic variables, which have some association with evacuation behavior, were found to have a very weak to no association with pre-evacuation trip-making; (2) Socio-demographic variables were found to have an association with predicting evacuation behavior for respondents making pre-evacuation trips, and these associations are consistent to what has been found in other studies of evacuation behavior; (3) Delays at stops are longer than delays on links; (4) Trip delays are associated with trip purpose; (5) Residents did not travel from a single origin point directly to an evacuation point, but made various preevacuation trips, often exhibiting trip chaining that included traveling toward as well as away from the city; (6) Though the Key West mandatory evacuation for Hurricane Wilma consisted of a phased evacuation based on housing types, the residents did not evacuate based on housing type, and (7) the personal stories offered by respondents indicate that evacuating or not is often related to job requirements, economic opportunity, previous evacuation experience, and evacuation burnout.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Female Faculty Experiences of Discrimination in Higher Education</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Cole, Kylie Gray</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The primary purpose of this study was to obtain a description of women faculty members’ experiences of discrimination in higher education. The phenomenological research methodology informed the study. Seventeen participants were asked to respond to the question, “Can you tell me about your experience of discrimination as a faculty member in a higher education institution?” The interviews were in-depth and unstructured. Verbatim transcripts of the audio-taped interviews were completed and a phenomenological research group analyzed the data using the phenomenological method. Two grounds and three main themes emerged from the data. The first ground was Minimize/Describe Discrimination. This captured the participants’ tendencies to deny or minimize discriminations at times and then to describe experiences of discrimination at other times. The second ground was Overt/Covert Discrimination. This ground served as the foundation for each of the themes. Participants’ descriptions varied between obvious and overt acts of discriminatory behavior to subtle and covert examples. The three main themes were: 1) Burdened, 2) Devalued, and 3) Supported. Each of these themes encompassed several sub-themes which illustrated the participants’ experiences of discrimination in higher education. The final chapter of this dissertation related the major findings of this study to existing literature and included research and practical implications of the findings.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Development of a Standardized Nursing Curriculum for the Alabama Community College System:  a Critical Case Study</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Raymond, Alice G.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this case study was to describe how the Alabama Community College System (ACCS) standardized their nursing curriculum. A single research question was the focus of the study: “How did the ACCS develop its standardized nursing curriculum?” The sub questions were, “who were the key players in the process?”, “Who had the positions of power and dominance, and who did not?”, “Who were included and who were excluded in the process?”, “What were the reasons for inclusion and exclusion?”, and “What were the contextual elements that influenced the development of the curriculum?”
Data from multiple sources were gathered. Key players in the curriculum development process were interviewed. Measures to ensure rigor, reliability and validity included those methods recommended by Yin (2003). Reliability was enhanced by using a case study protocol and audit trail. Construct validity was determined by triangulating data sources and member checks. Internal validity was enhanced by pattern matching with extant theories. External validity was established by verifying to see if the case study supported the theoretical framework.
The data collected was aggregated in categories (Stake, 1995), and further categorized into time-ordered displays. Content analysis (Merriam, 1998) of the data revealed emergent themes. The data was subjected to pattern-matching (Yin, 2003) with extant theories. The themes were compared to Foucault’s (1977) theories of knowledge and power. A timeline was created, story lines revealed the following themes inherent in the curriculum development process: speed and stealth, uncertainty, lack of power, lack of knowledge and lack of choice.
The participants’ group dynamics matched with Tuckman’s (1965) group development stages of Forming, Storming, Norming and Performing. Comparison to a published curriculum development process model (Iwasiw, Goldenberg &amp; Andrusyszyn, 2005) revealed that the actual curriculum development began with little preparation – the first eight stages in the model were bypassed. The program philosophy was created after the content was developed, and did not mesh with the curriculum. Power and knowledge relationships shifted from the administration to the faculty. Unanticipated gains included networking, sharing ideas and best practices. Weaknesses included admission criteria, loss of individuality, high student attrition, and issues with content allocation.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Investigation of hydrodynamic scaling relationships in shallow spouted beds</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lima Rojas, Irma Deytia</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Important global hydrodynamic relationships for shallow spouted beds of high-density particles were characterized in terms of three features: minimum spouting velocity, overall bed pressure drop at minimum spouting velocity; and fountain height. Spouted bed literature is sparse for shallow beds (static particle depth to bed diameter ≤ 1) and beds with heavy particles (density &gt; 3000 kg/m3). Correlations for such beds were developed here by varying column diameter, static bed height, particle diameter, particle density, gas density and gas flow in an ambient temperature and pressure bed.
The degree of correlation between each of the observed hydrodynamic features and a set of selected dimensionless groups from the literature was evaluated with principal components analysis. The minimum spouting velocity correlated strongly with the ratios of particle to bed diameter, of particle to gas density, and of static bed height to particle diameter, and weakly with Archimedes number. Overall bed pressure drop at minimum spouting correlated strongly with Archimedes number, the ratio of static bed height to particle diameter and Froude number. Fountain height correlated strongly with the ratios of the superficial gas velocity to minimum spouting velocity, of static bed height to particle diameter and of the particle to the bed diameter. Principal component regression models were developed for minimum spouting velocity, bed pressure drop, and fountain height with respect to a selected set of dimensionless parameters. All models have regression coefficient values exceeding 85%. Predictions using models developed in this study were compared with correlations in the literature and found to give better results for the experimental conditions studied. Most likely the literature models were less accurate because they were extrapolated.
Distinct bed pressure drop relationships with gas flow were observed for certain ranges of particle diameter and static bed height. In addition three dynamical spouting modes were observed, and named as regular, erratic and bimodal. A spouting regime map is proposed based on the spouting regimes defined in this investigation. The correspondence between bed pressure drop relationships and spouting regimes is still unclear.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Resolution of Hate: A Meaning Centered Analysis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Daniels, John M</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The present study analyzed participant descriptions of what it was like to resolve one’s hate toward someone or something. This experience was described as taking place in terms of a structure involving three phases: (1) When I Hated, (2) Resolution of Hate, and (3) After Hate. The first phase, When I Hated, was characterized by four themes: Power, Unjust, Significant, and Not Me. Phase 2, which concerned the Resolution of Hate, was described as a transition period defined by the themes of Choice, Separation/Distance, and Change in Perspective. The final phase, After Hate, was characterized by two themes: Burden Lifted and Release/Restoration. It appears from these results that as people learn to see the object of their hate from a different perspective they are able to resolve their hate and, in some cases, to restore a meaningful relationship to the object(s) of their former hate. The resolution of hate was often described in terms of collapse of one of the first three themes defining Phase 1; that is, the power dynamics of the situation changed and the initiating incident was now seen as either trivial or justified and the reason for continuing to hate was no longer experienced as significant. An understanding of how hate is resolved from a first person perspective has the potential for deepening our understanding of how hate is overcome and, on this basis, of leading to more effective interventions designed to help others resolve hate.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Essays on Urban Sprawl</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Marshall, Julie L.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Essay 1
Sprawl is an ill-defined and complex concept and this contributes to the difficulties in addressing it. Many studies and local policies are implemented without defining the very situation that is trying to be prevented. In this dissertation, I address this issue by computing and empirically testing a number of different measures that capture some of the elements of sprawl. While controlling for a number of other explanatory factors, I examine different fiscal factors that may contribute to the level of sprawl an area experiences. Because the property tax is the predominant source of local tax revenue, my main focus is on the impact that property tax rates have on sprawl in metropolitan areas. I next examine how the reliance on different types of revenue sources influence sprawl. I then offer insight into how local governments may use this information to look at their own sprawl issues. I find that higher property taxes are found in areas with lower degrees of sprawl, but that greater property tax differentials result in more sprawl.
Essay 2
The second essay of this dissertation addresses one of the inefficiencies often attributed to sprawl: the increase in the cost of delivering public services. Although this is one of the most common complaints concerning sprawl, there have been few studies examining how sprawl impacts public service costs. Using the same sprawl measures as in the first essay, I examine how differing levels of sprawl impact the costs of not only total public service expenditures, but also a number of local services important to residents. With this essay, I contribute to the debate on the relationship between sprawl and public service costs. The results of this study show that sprawl has a very limited relationship with most types of local public service expenditures.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Climate-Driven Impacts of Groundfish on Food Webs in the Northern Bering Sea</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Cui, Xuehua</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Groundfish distributions were examined in spring 2006 and 2007 in the northern Bering Sea around St. Lawrence Island (SLI). Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida), Bering flounder (Hippoglossoides robustus), and snailfish (Liparidae) were the dominant species south of SLI, whereas Arctic alligatorfish (Ulcina olrikii) and Arctic staghorn sculpin (Gymnocanthus tricuspis), or shorthorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius) were dominant north of SLI. The results indicate that bottom water (or water column) chlorophyll a and sediment parameters had greater influence on fish distribution in 2006 (cold, pre-bloom conditions), whereas bottom water temperature and sediment grain size were more important in 2007 (warm, bloom conditions) among a total of 14 environmental variables that were analyzed. These findings suggest strong linkages between physical conditions (e.g. water temperature and hydrography as it affects sediment grain size) and biological conditions (e.g. bloom status) in structuring fish communities in the northern Bering Sea.
The diet and feeding relationship of six dominant groundfish, specifically Arctic cod, Bering flounder, snailfish, Arctic staghorn sculpin, Arctic alligatorfish, and shorthorn sculpin in the northern Bering Sea were studied using stomach content data in spring 2006 and 2007. All of Bering flounder had empty stomachs. Amphipods were the primary prey in five fish species characterized by feeding narrow niches except snailfish, which consumed a diverse diet. Arctic cod was the only occasional pelagic feeder; all the other fish studied were benthic feeders. High diet overlap was found among some fish species; however, competition was likely reduced by differences in feeding strategies and available food resources.
Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes of groundfish and their potential prey items were measured for trophic relationships and energy flow in the northern Bering Sea in 2006 and 2007. Lipid content impacts on stable isotope analyses were reduced using a mathematical normalization technique using C/N ratios. Values of del13C in fish species showed significantly different between seasons. Trophic levels (TL) were estimated by del15N values of fish and prey species with primary consumer as a baseline indicator. Bivalves and amphipods had the lowest TL values, 2.4 – 3.4, followed by polychaetes (TL = 3.6 – 4.1), and fish (TL = 3.5 – 4.6).</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Impact of Sarbanes-Oxley on Bank CEO and Director Compensation</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Javine, Victoria</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study examines the impact of Sarbanes-Oxley on CEO compensation and director compensation for banks. The presence of pre-SOX regulation in the banking industry, particularly, FIRREA and FDICIA, suggests that SOX may affect banks differently than other industries. Specifically, this study examines the changes in the trends for CEO compensation and for director compensation for banks over time. The results indicate that compensation for directors and CEOs has changed for all firms over time, but the sign and the significance of the change varies with respect to the type of compensation. Additionally, the differences in director/CEO compensation for banks and industrial firms have also changed over time. Whether or not the changes in the gap between compensation for banks and industrials is a consequence of banks being financial firms or banks being regulated firms varies depending on the type of compensation.
The results show that bank directors are paid more cash compensation, more total compensation, and less in levels but not proportions of equity-based compensation after SOX when compared to before SOX levels. Additionally, all forms of compensation are lower for banks than non-banks after SOX. Director cash, equity, and total compensation increased for all firms from before to after SOX. There is no significant change in the difference of any form of director compensation from before to after SOX.
Similar to the director compensation results, the results for CEO compensation indicate that bank CEOs are paid less cash compensation, less total compensation, and less in levels of equity-based compensation and less in percent of equity after SOX. Additionally, the level of equity compensation and total compensation are lower for banks than non-banks after SOX. However, there is no difference in cash or percent equity compensation between banks and non-banks after SOX. The results suggest that the gap between bank CEO compensation and industrial CEO compensation for equity and total compensation is widening and it may be driven by the fact that banks are financial firms. The evidence also supports the notion that the widening gap between CEO compensation between banks and industrials may be driven by bank regulation</dc:description>
