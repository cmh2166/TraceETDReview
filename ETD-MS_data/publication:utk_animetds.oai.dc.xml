			<dc:title>&lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; Pathogenesis and Subunit Vaccine Development</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Zeng, Ximin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Campylobacter jejuni is the leading bacterial cause of human gastroenteritis in the United States. Increasing resistance of Campylobacter to clinical antibiotics raises an urgent need for novel strategies to prevent and control infections in humans and animal reservoirs, which necessitates a better understanding of Campylobacter pathogenesis. We hypothesize that multidrug efflux pump CmeABC and ferric enterobactin (FeEnt) iron acquisition systems, which play a critical role in Campylobacter pathogenesis, are novel targets for developing effective measures against Campylobacter. To test this, the molecular, antigenic, functional, and protective characteristics of two outer membrane proteins, CmeC (an essential component of CmeABC drug efflux pump) and CfrA (a FeEnt receptor), were examined. Both CmeC and CfrA are highly conserved and widely produced in C. jejuni strains. Anti-CmeC and Anti-CfrA antibodies inhibited the function of CmeABC efflux pump and CfrA, resulting enhanced susceptibility to bile salts and reduced utilization of FeEnt of C. jejuni, respectively. Immunoblotting analysis also indicated that CfrA is expressed and immunogenic in vivo. Amino acid substitution mutagenesis demonstrated that a highly conserved basic amino acid R327 in CfrA plays a critical role in FeEnt acquisition. The purified recombinant CmeC and a Salmonella live vaccine expressing the protective epitope of CfrA were evaluated as subunit vaccines against Campylobacter infection in the chicken model. CmeC vaccination elicited immune response but failed to reduce C. jejuni colonization in the intestine.  However, Salmonella-vectored vaccine conferred significant protection against C. jejuni challenge. To further elucidate the role of iron acquisition in the pathogenesis of Campylobacter, whole genome sequence of a unique C. jejuni strain was determined using a 454 GS FLX sequencer with Titanium series reagents. Comparative genomics analysis led to the identification of a novel Campylobacter Enterobactin Esterase (Cee) that is essential in the CfrB-dependent FeEnt utilization pathway. Extensive genetic manipulation revealed molecular pathways and mechanistic features of the two orchestrated FeEnt acquisition systems in Campylobacter. This project provides critical information about the feasibility of targeting CmeC and CfrA for immune protection against Campylobacter colonization in the intestine, and increases our understanding of the critical role of FeEnt acquisition in the pathophysiology of Campylobacter.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Identifying Mechanisms Associated with Innate Immunity in Cows Genetically Susceptible to Mastitis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Elliott, Alexandra Alida</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Mastitis, or mammary gland inflammation, causes the greatest loss in profit for dairy producers. Mastitis susceptibility differs among cows due to environmental, physiological, and genetic factors. Prior research identified a genetic marker in a chemokine receptor, CXCR1, associated with mastitis susceptibility and decreased neutrophil migration. Current research seeks to identify reasons behind mastitis susceptibility by validating this model through in vivo challenge with Streptococcus uberis and studying specific mechanisms causing impaired neutrophil migration. Holstein cows with GG (n=19), GC (n=28), and CC (n=20) genotypes at CXCR1+777 were challenged intramammarily with S. uberis strain UT888. After challenge 68% of quarters from GG genotype, 74% from CC genotype and only 47% from GC genotype cows had ≥10 colony forming units/ml S. uberis for at least two sampling time points (P&lt;0.05). However, among infected cows, number of S. uberis, somatic cell count, rectal temperature, milk scores and mammary scores were comparable among genotypes throughout infection. These findings suggest that cows with GC genotypes may be more resistant to S. uberis mastitis, but have similar responses if infected. To better understand the mechanisms associated with disease resistance, migration patterns in neutrophils from cows with different CXCR1+777 genotypes were evaluated. Neutrophils from cows with GG (n=11) and CC (n=11) genotypes were isolated and stimulated with zymosan activated sera (ZAS). Cells were fixed and stained for F-actin and evaluated for F-actin content, distribution, and cell morphology. Neutrophils from CC cows had significantly lower average F-actin polymerization than GG cows v (P=0.05). Directed migration of neutrophils from GG (n=10) and CC (n=10) genotypes was imaged and tracking data was analyzed for individual cells. Cells from GG genotype traveled further on an X axis and had higher X/Y movement towards IL8 compared to CC genotype, meaning they moved more directly towards IL8. Our findings suggest lower F-actin polymerization in combination with lower ability to directly move towards IL8 could impair neutrophil response to infection in cows with a CC genotype and may contribute to increased mastitis susceptibility. Finding what makes certain cows more susceptible to mastitis could lead to strategies aimed at improved prevention and treatment of mastitis.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effects of Egg Yolk Antibodies on Weanling Pigs Challenged with Pathogenic &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt; Typhimurium</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Rattanatabtimtong, Sukanya</dc:creator>
<dc:description>An experiment was conducted to determine effects of anti-Salmonella egg yolk antibodies (ASEYA) on shedding and antibiotic resistance of Salmonella enterica Typhimurium and E. coli, growth performance and immunological parameters. Weaned pigs in two replicate trials (n = 132) were randomly assigned to six dietary treatments, including a control diet without additives, apramycin followed by carbadox, oxytetracycline (OXY), egg yolk powder containing ASEYA, egg yolk powder lacking ASEYA, or spray dried plasma protein (SDPP). Treatments were given to pigs on day 3 of the trial and all pigs were intranasally and orally challenged with Salmonella Typhimurium containing a nalidixic acid resistance marker on day 7. Fecal samples were collected on day 0, 7, 8, 12, 14, 21, 58, 88, and 118 for detection of Salmonella and E. coli to determine shedding and antibiotic resistance. Blood samples were collected and rectal temperatures (RT) were measured on day 0, 7, 8, 12, 14, 21, and 28. Blood was analyzed for white blood cell (WBC) counts and serum was analyzed for Salmonella antibody and interleukin-1β (IL-1β). The percentage of pigs shedding Salmonella was lower (P&lt;0.05) for antibiotic treatments compared to other diets; however, resistance was greater (P&lt;0.05) in E. coli from pigs fed antibiotics. Weight gains did not differ between treatments. Pigs fed OXY had lower RT compared to pigs fed SDPP and ASEYA (P&lt;0.05); however, pigs in all groups had higher RT 24 h after challenge (P&lt;0.05) and had decreasing RT by day 12. Concentrations of anti-Salmonellaa antibodies and WBC counts did not differ between treatment groups. Salmonella antibody concentrations increased in all groups beginning on day 14 and continued to increase through day 28 (P&lt;0.05). IL-1β was generally below detection limits. These studies indicate that in-feed ASEYA may not be effective in controlling shedding of Salmonella or improving the performance or health status of pigs challenged with Salmonella likely because ASEYA cannot reach invasive Salmonella that move through routes outside of the GI tract and/or because ASEYA lose activity as a result of animal digestive processes.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>“Development of Genetic and Genomic Predictors of Fertility in Argentinean Holstein Cattle.”</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Di Croce, Fernando Alfonso</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The overall aim of the studies described herein was to evaluate genetic variation in cattle fertility traits for development of genetic and genomic predictors in breeding strategies. Results from these experiments suggest that improvements in fertility through genetic selection are a possible approach to increase reproductive efficiency. Experiment 1 evaluated the development of genetic parameters associated with multiple ovulation and embryo transfer schemes in an attempt to assist producers in identifying animals with greater genetic merit for these protocols. This study confirmed that genetic selection of donors or sires appears to be a potential approach to improve efficiency of MOET procedures. Although low heritability would slow the progress, results shown in this work suggest that genetic improvement in fertility by selection for embryo transfer traits is possible. Experiment 2 evaluated fertility traits in Argentinean Holstein cattle in order to develop fertility genetic predictors for utilization in breeding strategies. The dollar fertility index ($F) included age to first calving (AFC) as a measure of initial reproductive performance and calving interval (CI) as an indicator of conception rate and success of early insemination. Values for $F ranged from -$76.6 to $139.4 in the current Holstein population. Results indicated substantial variation in fertility traits, suggesting that genetic selection would be highly effective in improving fertility.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Direct Effects of Heat Stress During Meiotic Maturation on Bovine Oocyte and Cumulus RNA</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Payton, Rebecca R.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Heat-induced reductions in developmental competence after direct exposure of oocytes to 41ºC have been coincident with reduced protein synthesis. Since heat stress perturbs RNA integrity and polyadenylation in somatic cells, it was hypothesized that heat stress during meiotic maturation may alter RNA within oocytes and/or their surrounding cumulus to account for some of the reductions in development. Initial efforts utilized microcapillary electrophoresis to examine oocyte and cumulus RNA without heat stress as a first step toward transcriptome profile analysis. Size distribution of RNA, rRNA ratio, and other related endpoints differed for oocyte RNA compared to cumulus, and were conserved across other mammalian species. Size distribution of polyadenylated RNA after amplification was similar for oocytes and cumulus.
Effects of heat stress on total and polyadenylated RNA, RNA size distribution, and individual transcripts important for meiotic maturation and response to heat stress were examined in oocytes and cumulus during maturation, and resultant embryos after fertilization. There was no impact of heat stress during the first 12 h of maturation to alter size distribution of RNA, rRNA ratio, and other endpoints in oocytes or cumulus. Heat stress perturbed the abundance of polyadenylated RNA in oocytes in one study. Abundance of eight examined transcripts was not altered after exposure to elevated temperature, suggesting that the impact of heat stress on oocyte RNA, if any, was subtle.
Consequences of elevated temperature exposure during maturation on transcriptomes of oocytes and their surrounding cumulus vestment were investigated using microarray technology. Thousands of transcripts changed in oocytes and surrounding cumulus over meiotic maturation, some in a stage-specific and amplification-dependent manner. Culture at elevated temperature for the first 12 h of meiotic maturation impacted a small proportion of transcripts in matured oocytes and cumulus at 24 h. Alterations suggested perturbations in oocyte mitochondrial function, and intracellular signaling and extracellular matrix production in cumulus. Heat-induced alterations in oocyte mitochondria and cumulus expansion are supported by existing literature. The findings discussed here are informative of heat-induced molecular alterations in oocytes and cumulus and may prove useful for development of strategies to mitigate negative impacts of heat stress on fertility.</dc:description>

Primary treatments consisted of control (KLH) or immunization (INH) plus a combination of saline, FSH, or GnRH. Administration of FSH at the time of initial immunization against inhibin significantly increased number of germ cells (92.2 ± 9 x 106 cells) compared to INH-Saline bulls (54.9 ± 10 x 106 cells) with INH-GnRH bulls being intermediate (64.5 ± 9 x 106 cells; P &lt; 0.05). These results suggested that gonadotropin administration at time of inhibin immunization increases number of germ cells in the testis. Experiment 2 evaluated transiently induced ischemia in testes of Jersey calves on morphology and development. Treatments consisted of control or banding for 2 h, 4 h, and 8 h periods. Transiently induced ischemia significantly decreased number of germ cells in 8 h (12.6 ± 5 x 106 cells) compared to 0 (38.1 ± 6 x 106 cells), 2 (31.9 ± 6 x 106 cells), and 4 h (33.4 ± 5 x 106 cells; P &lt; 0.05). These results suggested that transiently-induced ischemia significantly decreases number of germ, Sertoli and Leydig cells in the testis. Experiment 3 evaluated spermatogonial stem cells (SSC) proliferation, isolated from prepubertal and adult bulls, during short term in vitro culture. Spermatogonia were cultured in the presence or absence of a feeder monolayer (FL or NF), FBS type (FBS-S or FBS-SF), and media type (ELSC or RSC) treatment combinations. Viable type A spermatogonia survived under in vitro conditions and were able to proliferate and form different types of colonies. Furthermore, co-culture spermatogonial cells with a feeder monolayer plus FBS-S enhanced colony number (may be due to increasing cell viability). At 15 days of culture, colonies from both types of bulls were positive to AP. Therefore, these finding provide the basis for potential production of offspring through in vitro genetic manipulation such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), round spermatid injection (ROSI), or following SSC transfer.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Prevalence of Class 1 Integrons and Antibiotic Resistance Patterns in Bacteria of Swine and Chicken in the US and Thailand</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Liamthong, Sumalee</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Studies were conducted to investigate the prevalence and potential for transfer of class 1 integrons and antimicrobial resistance in bacteria of broiler chickens and swine from the US and Thailand. Antibiograms were characterized and integron sequences were detected using standard methods. To determine if transfer of integrons occurred between bacterial species the location of the integrons (plasmid versus chromosome) was determined, and when integron-positive E. coli and Salmonella isolates possessed identical amplicon patterns, PCR products were sequenced to determine homology. Class 1 integrons were detected in 1,732 of 3,824 isolates from broiler chickens and 1,782 of 4,253 isolates from swine. Simultaneous presence of three conserved class 1 integron genes was found in 1,044 and 215 of isolates from chickens and swine, respectively. A high proportion of bacterial isolates from chickens demonstrated resistance to tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole, cephalothin, and ampicillin. A high proportion of isolates from swine demonstrated resistance to tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin, and ampicillin. Nine integron amplicons, with sizes ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 kb, were found, and we discovered a single swine farm on which similar integrons were observed in both E. coli and Salmonella. Sequence analysis revealed that a 1.0 kb amplicon found in both bacterial species contained an aadA1 gene cassette encoding aminoglycosides 3’-adenyltransferase, confering resistance to streptomycin and spectinomycin. A 2.0 kb amplicon was also found in both types of bacteria containing the aadA5 gene encoding aminoglycosides 3’-adenyltransferase, an additional reading frame with unknown function, orfD, as well as a dfrA17 gene encoding dihydrofolate reductase, conferring resistance to trimethoprim. Our results indicate that class 1 integrons are common in commensal and foodborne bacteria in broiler chickens and swine, and that some, but not all antibiotic resistances are associated with the presence of class 1 integrons. Identical integrons found in Salmonella and E. coli from a single farm likely indicate transfer between these two organisms occurs via exchange of plasmids. This work provides additional knowledge regarding the complex nature of antibiotic resistance gene acquisition, reservoirs, and transfer that should aid in development of courses of action and strategies for control of these potential foodborne and zoonotic hazards.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Mechanisms of Antimicrobial Peptide Resistance in Campylobacter</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hoang, Ky Van</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Campylobacter is the major bacterial cause of human gastroenteritis in the United States and other developed countries. Poultry are considered a main source of human Campylobacter infections. Thus, reduction of Campylobacter load in poultry is significant in food safety and public health. However, no effective measure is commercially available to prevent Campylobacter colonization in poultry to date. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are short and bactericidal peptides widely present in intestine to limit bacterial infections. Recently, AMPs have been increasingly recognized as a novel class of antibiotics (peptide antibiotics) to control foodborne pathogens. Notably, several potent anti-Campylobacter bacteriocins, a group of AMPs produced by commensal bacteria, dramatically reduced C. jejuni colonization in chickens and are being directed toward on-farm control of this pathogen to protect public health. As an important strategy to evade killing by potential peptide antibiotics and by host innate defense, AMP resistance mechanisms in C. jejuni are critical to understand, but are still unknown. In this dissertation, molecular basis of Campylobacter resistance to polymyxin B, the anti-Campylobacter bacteriocins (BCNs), and a chicken host defense AMP (fowlicidin-1) was comprehensively examined using both in vitro and in vivo systems. Although polymyxin B has been successfully used as a model peptide to study AMP resistance in other Gram-negative bacteria, functional genomics examination in this study suggested that polymyxin B is not a good surrogate to study Campylobacter resistance to physiologically relevant AMPs. Campylobacter only developed low-level BCN resistance with low frequency in vitro and in vivo; the acquired BCN resistance was not stable in Campylobacter. Genomic examination of two BCN resistant mutants using DNA microarray and random transposon mutagenesis revealed that the multidrug efflux pump CmeABC contributes to both intrinsic and acquired resistance of Campylobacter to the BCNs. Random transposon mutagenesis and targeted site-directed mutagenesis identified four genes (cbrR, tig, cjaB, and cj1583c) involved in Campylobacter resistance to fowlicidin-1. These genes were also required for optimal colonization of Campylobacter in chickens. Together, the findings from this dissertation revealed uniqueness and complexity of AMP resistance in Campylobacter and will enable us to develop more sustainable peptide antibiotics and novel intervention strategies to prevent and control Campylobacter infections in humans and animal reservoirs. Key words: Campylobacter, antimicrobial peptide resistance, polymyxin B, bacteriocins, fowlicidins</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effect of double interspiking on fertility, behavior, and blood parameters in broiler breeder males reared under heat stress conditions</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Chung, Karianne Mei-Ying</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Broiler breeders experience a natural decline in fertility levels as a flock ages.  A male management practice such as double interspiking could be applied to counteract this decline.  Our objective was to investigate the effects of double interspiking on flock fertility, testosterone concentrations, stress responses, and behavioral responses of broiler breeders in heat stressed environments.  Two hundred and eighty-eight broiler breeder pullets and thirty-six broiler breeder roosters (Ross 708) were assigned to three groups at 21 weeks of age (WOA).  All three groups were housed in slatted floor pens in which room temperature cycled from 23.8 to 30 C to mimic heat stressed environments.  Double interspiking was carried out between two pens at 42 and 52 WOA.  Beginning at 32 WOA, eggs were set every two weeks, candled at day 12, and percent fertility calculated.  Concentrations of the hormones testosterone and corticosterone (CS) were measured by radioimmunoassays at specific time points in the experiment.  Lymphocytes and heterophils were counted in order to calculate heterophil:lymphocyte (H:L) ratios.  Behavior was monitored with Panasonic video cameras which recorded video footage using the Noldus MPEG Recorder from 1900 hr to 2100 hr at specific time points.  Recordings were analyzed, and frequency of specific behavioral responses of individual (preening, feather ruffling, wing flapping), male-to-male (fighting, pecking, retreating), and male-to-female (attempted and completed mating) behaviors were assessed.  The introduction of unfamiliar roosters resulted in a fertility increase (P&lt;0.01) between control and spiked birds after the first interspike and a sustainment of fertility levels after the second interspike.  Testosterone concentrations declined (P&lt;0.0001) from 1.95ng/mL to 0.11ng/mL as the birds aged. Corticosterone concentrations differed among bird groups and was elevated (P=.0333) for both groups that were interspiked.  H:L ratios were also different among bird groups with all birds housed in the interspiked rooms showing higher ratios.  Double interspiking increased the occurrence of male-to-male interactions, but there were no significant differences in male-to-female or individual behaviors.  Regardless of treatment, there was a decrease in male-to-female behaviors as the birds aged.  Double interspiking does show promise as a tool to increase fertility levels in a broiler breeder flock.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Validation of a Three Dimensional Motion Capture System for Use in Identifying Characteristics of the Running Walk</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Roberson, Paul</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Validation of a Three Dimensional Motion Capture System for Use in Identifying Characteristics of the Running Walk
A three-dimensional (3-D) motion capture system was adapted for use in characterizing the biomechanics of the Running Walk, a stepping gait of the Tennessee Walking Horse (TWH) breed. Registered TWH (n = 4) were ridden through an arrangement of high-speed digital cameras at the walk (W) and running walk (RW). Infrared reflective markers (65 per horse) were used to track body segments and joint centers. Five trials per gait per horse were recorded. A dynamic 3-D model was created and used to label and track body segments. Temporal stride characteristics and joint angle values were extracted by a custom script file and gait formulas were calculated for each gait per horse. Temporal stride characteristics and gait formulas of both W and RW were found to be similar to those previously reported. Overstride (OS), which has not previously been described, increased from W to RW (P &lt; 0.0001). The increase in OS accounted for 96% of the increase in stride length; only 4% of the increase in stride length is due to an increase in step length. OS was positively correlated to velocity and stride length (P &lt; 0.0001), and negatively correlated to front stance duration, hind stance duration and total stance duration (P &lt; 0.0001). A long OS would appear to be related to the flexibility of the proximal hind limb, the pelvis and possibly the lumbar spine. Hind stance duration as a percent of total stride time, advance placement as a percent of total stride time, and advance liftoff as a percent of total stride time did not differ between W and RW (P &gt; 0.05), suggesting that the RW is not simply a faster version of W. 3-D analysis allowed for thorough analysis of joint angles. The joint angles of the carpus were highly correlated to stride length, OS, and advance placement (P &lt; 0.0001), but were not correlated to velocity (P &gt; 0.05). These joint angles and gait events can be viewed as velocity-independent stride characteristics and may be suitable for making comparisons between horses traveling at different velocities. Identification of joint-specific velocity-independent stride characteristics may enhance our ability to associate lameness with an individual joint.

			<dc:title>Fertilization Characteristics of Spermatozoa Collected from Bulls Grazing Tall Fescue Pastures</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Harris, Jessica Pegan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Consumption of toxic endophyte-infected (E+) tall fescue pastures is known to have a negative impact on bull reproductive performance. Since decreased cleavage rates of embryos fertilized with spermatozoa from bulls grazing E+ tall fescue pastures have been observed in several studies using differing sets of bulls, technicians, pastures, and other methods of inducing tall fescue toxicosis (ergotamine tartrate), it is hypothesized that spermatozoa function from bulls grazing E+ is impaired in ways undetectable by gross semen examination.
During a three-month grazing study, 6 Angus bulls were utilized to determine the effects of grazing E+ tall fescue pastures on growth performance and spermatozoa function. Bulls were appointed to graze Kentucky 31 tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) infected with Neotyphodium coenophialum, an ergot alkaloid producing endophyte (n=3) or Jesup tall fescue infected with non-ergot alkaloid producing endophyte (NTE) MaxQTM (n=3). Bulls were grouped by body weight (BW) and scrotal circumference (SC) to graze pastures from April 18-June 26, 2007. Blood samples, BW, SC, semen, and rectal temperatures (RT) were collected every 7 d. Scrotal temperatures (ST) were obtained before semen collection each week in June. Semen was evaluated for gross motility, morphology, and Computer Assisted Semen Analysis (CASA) parameters. Semen from a subset of bulls (n=2 per treatment) was used to assess spermatozoa ability to function utilizing in vitro assays.
Growth performance was decreased in E+ bulls compared to bulls grazing NTE tall fescue pastures (P = 0.002). Concentrations of prolactin were reduced in bulls grazing E+ compared to bulls grazing NTE tall fescue pastures (P = 0.055). Motility post-thaw and during a 3-hour stress test were decreased (P = 0.024 and P &lt; 0.0001, respectively), in addition to altered CASA parameters for spermatozoa. Penetration was reduced in oocytes fertilized with spermatozoa from bulls grazing E+ (64.54 ± 3.28%) compared to NTE tall fescue pastures (87.42 ± 1.63%, P &lt; 0.0001) coupled with hastened meiotic completion, and reduced intracellular calcium parameters. These findings indicate impaired spermatozoa function in bulls grazing E+ tall fescue pastures that extends beyond gross semen characteristics, and may provide direction for future studies.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effects of Weaning and Syndyphalin-33 on Appetite Regulators in Swine</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Cooper, Tabatha Anne</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The synthetic met-enkephalin syndyphalin-33 (SD-33) increases feed intak in sheep and recently-weaned pigs. An experiment focused on changes in hypothalamic levels of mRNA transcripts from the following genes: μ-opioid receptor (MOR), neuropeptide Y (NPY), orexin (hypocretin; HCRT), melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R), and agouti-related protein (AGRP). There was no effect of treatment on BW or FI at any point in the study. There is a strong positive correlation (p &lt;0.001) between MOR and MC4 that remains regardless of treatment or time. Weaning resulted in a numerical increase in hypothalamic MOR mRNA expression. There was a treatment effect of MOR expression levels 4 days postweaning. Hypothalamic NPY expression was unchanged through time or treatment. In VEH pigs, weaning resulted in increased hypothalamic expression of the HCRT gene at d 1 and d 7 postweaning (P(time) &lt; 0.01). In SD pigs, an increase in HCRTexpression (relative to d 0) was observed at d 4 postweaning. Expression of HCRT did not significantly differ between treatment groups at d 1 and d 4, but HCRT expression was greater in VEH pigs than in SD pigs at d 7 (P(time x treatment) &lt; 0.05). Expression of hypothalamic MC4R did not change through time, but a trend (P(treatment) = 0.07) was observed such that expression was less in SD pigs than in VEH pigs on d 1 and d 4 postweaning, possibly due to a numerical increase in expression in VEH pigs on d 1 relative to d 0.  Expression of AGRP was decreased 1 d postweaning in VEH pigs but not in SD pigs,. On d 4, levels of AGRP expression were lower in SD pigs than in VEH pigs, and lower than d 0 levels as well. On d7, AGRP expression was less in VEH pigs than in SD pigs (P(time x treatment) &lt; 0.01). Syndyphalin-33 has the potential to alleviate the negative effects of stress during weaning, and has the potential to increase feed intake through the melanocortinergic pathway.

			<dc:title>Red Clover Hays of Varying Phosphorous Content for Growing Beef Calves</dc:title>
<dc:creator>McFarlin, Ben Hall</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Introduction: The Tennessee Valley Authority is vitally interested in the effect of phosphorous on crop yields and the nutritional value of these crops on livestock. They manufacture different phosphatic fertilizers and test them on farms and in laboratories. Financial assistance is given by the Tennessee Valley Authority to the Tennessee Experiment Station in this study of the feeding value of clover hays of varying phosphorous contents for growing beef calves. This experiment was originated to (1) study growth of calves fed rations differing only in the phosphorous content of the red clover hay; and (2) to study the availability to growing beef calves of the phosphorous in the red clover hays having a different phosphorous content.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Possible Strategies to Increase Ovulatory Follicle Size and Reduce Time to Ovulation in Lactating Dairy Cows</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Giordano, Julio Omar</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Specific objectives of this study were to examine growth response of the dominant follicle (DF) after administration of Folltropin-V (FSH and LH) at onset of luteolysis and investigate use of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) for decreasing ovulation time in lactating Holstein cows. On day 8 or 9 of a synchronized cycle, cows (n = 35) received an EAZI-BREED CIDR plus 100 μg of GnRH. CIDRs were removed 7 days later and cows were administered 500 μg cloprostenol. Concurrently, cows were randomly allocated to receive either 80 mg Folltropin-V (FSH, n = 19) or 4 mL of sterile saline (SAL, n = 16). Forty-nine hours later, cows that had received Folltropin-V or Saline were randomly subdivided to receive either 100 μg dose of GnRH or 3000 IU of hCG. Ultrasonography was performed to assess growth of the ovulatory follicle and confirm ovulation. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS. Size of the ovulatory follicle at time of GnRH/hCG administration was not different between Folltropin-V or Saline groups (17.1 ± 0.7 vs. 17.7 ± 0.6 mm, respectively; P = 0.521). Total growth of the ovulatory follicle from CIDR removal to GnRH/hCG administration did not differ between FSH (3.2 ± 0.6 mm) and Saline-treated cows (3.3 ± 0.4 mm; P = 0.891). When assessed from time of CIDR removal, ovulation occurred at a similar time for Folltropin-V (76.9 ± 0.7 h) and Saline-treated cows (78.0 ± 0.5 h; P = 0.196). When calculated from time of LH or hCG peak to ovulation, FSH-hCG cows presented the shortest time to ovulation (19.9 ± 0.4 h; P = 0.066). Whereas, from GnRH/hCG administration to ovulation, FSH-GnRH presented the earliest ovulation (25.0 ± 1.2 h; P = 0.013). In conclusion, Folltropin-V did not increase size of the ovulatory follicle at the time of GnRH/hCG administration. However, earlier ovulation occurred when combined with hCG as measured from time of gonadotropin peak. Conversely, when ovulation time is calculated from GnRH/hCG administration, FSH-GnRH produced the earliest ovulation.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Effects of Weaning Strategy on the Physiology and Performance of Beef Calves</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Campistol, Cristina</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Two experiments examined growth performance and physiological measures of stress in pre- and postweaned Angus steers (313 ± 24.5 kg; n = 48/Exp.), where steers were fitted with (YD) or without (ND) an anti-suckling device (Exp. 1), or provided (YS) or not provided (NS) a grain supplement (Exp. 2) for 7 d and weaned by fenceline (FS) or total separation (TS). Steers in Exp. 1 were weighed and bled on d 0, 3, 7  10, 14, 21, and 42, and in Exp. 2, on d 0, 7, 10, 14, and 21 and provided a grain supplement on d 7-21. In Exp. 1, weight gain was not different (P = 0.74) between ND and YD steers during preweaning. The YD-FS steers lost weight (P = 0.01) by d 10 compared with YD-TS steers. Hematocrit (Hct) increased (P = 0.04) in YD but not ND steers on d 3. Neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (N:L) increased (P &lt; 0.01) in all steers by d 7. Cortisol values in YD-FS steers were higher (P &lt; 0.05) compared with YD-TS steers on d 10 and 21. The ND-FS steers had higher (P = 0.04) interferon-gamma (IFN) concentrations on d 10 compared with all YD steers. Haptoglobin (HAP) values increased (P &lt; 0.01) in all steers by d 3. The FS steers had higher (P &lt; 0.01) ceruloplasmin (CER) values by d 10 than TS steers regardless of preweaning treatment. Ovalbumin-specific IgG increased (P &lt; 0.01) in all steers 10 d following its administration. In  Exp. 2, NS-TS steers lost weight (P &lt; 0.01) between d 7 and 10  compared with the remaining steers. The YS steers had higher cortisol, N:L and CER  on d 7 compared with NS steers. Moreover, NS steers had higher (P &lt; 0.01) Hct on d 10 than YS steers. Based upon physiological and growth  performance data, it may be concluded that use of an anti-suckling device prior to weaning does not improve the animals’ well-being and, providing a grain supplement beginning 7 d prior to weaning may temper the animals’ stress response due to weaning when total separation is employed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Regional Differences in Adipose Tissue of the Sinclair Minipig</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Booker, Suzanne Lauren</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Adipose tissue is an endocrine organ, and its homeostatic mechanisms in normal weight, overweight and obese subjects must be elucidated.   We sought to determine the basal adipose tissue biology of visceral (VIF) and subcutaneous (SQF) fat depots in 8 month old Sinclair minipigs, an animal that has been shown to be physiologically similar to humans.
Metabolic analysis showed a decrease in LDL, white blood cells (WBC), and lymphocyte percentages as the minipigs aged from 6 to 8 months (p &lt;0.0001 and = 0.0046 and 0.0165 respectively).  There were no significant changes in triglycerides, HDL, VLDL, and neutrophil percentages.  There was a trend in insulin increase (P=0.0722).
Microarray analysis was performed to determine transcriptome differences between VIF and SQF.  When VIF was compared to SQF, expression of a total of 788 transcript ID’s differed: were 240 up-regulated and 548 down-regulated.   Examples included hydroxysteroid 11-beta dehydrogenase 2, fatty acid synthase, IL-18, and platelet factor 4 which were all up-regulated in VIF vs. SQF.  The down-regulated transcripts included estrogen receptor 1, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5, and platelet derived growth factor D.
When SQF was compared to VIF, a total of 598 transcript IDs were up or down-regulated by more than a 2 fold difference (P&lt;0.05).  From this subset of the transcriptome, we found 471 IDs were up-regulated in SQ fat, and 127 were down- regulated. Interestingly, the up-regulated genes included prostaglandin F2 receptor negative regulator, estrogen receptor 1, thrombospondin 1, lipoprotein related receptor protein 2, and platelet derived growth factor D.  Down-regulated genes in SQF compared to VIF included IL-18, platelet factor 4, cyclooxygenase, and fatty acid synthase.  We found no significant difference in gene expression between SQF and VIF TNF alpha, TLR 4, and adiponectin in our.
Immunofluorensce (IF) assay revealed that SQF expressed more CD 163 positive (alternatively activated) macrophages than VIF, and little to no CD 68 (classically activated) positive macrophages.  Additionally, VIF expressed more CD 68 positive macrophages compared to SQF.
The data from this study is consistent with the human and rodent literature which states that VIF is more metabolically active and pro-inflammatory compared to SQF.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effects of Syndyphalin-33 on appetite, endocrine, and immune parameters in the recently weaned pig</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Jenkins, Sarah Jo</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis discusses the background information regarding the physiological effects the pig encounters during weaning as well as a potential factor that can be used to assist the pig during this time. Specifically, the research focus is to assess the ability of the tri-peptide opioid agonist, Syndyphalin-33 (SD-33), to increase feed intake and body weight and modulate immune responses during the post-weaning period. The results of this research have demonstrated that SD-33 increases feed intake, transiently increases growth hormone and cortisol levels, and increases total white blood cell counts while selectively increasing monocyte numbers in healthy weaned pigs. This research also demonstrates that, although co-treatment with SD-33 during an immune challenge of Salmonella enterica did not result in increased feed intake, SD-33 exerted effects relating to increasing the circulating populations of immune cells at 48 h postinjections, selectively increasing monocyte numbers. Based on these results, SD-33 may have the potential to be used as an agent to decrease the negative effects of stress during weaning in pigs. However, further investigation is needed to better understand the timing of effect, and to rule out any immunosuppressive effects, which would be detrimental to the animal’s well-being.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Supplementation of Energy and Glucomannan to Alleviate Tall Fescue Toxicosis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Mills, Rodney Lynn</dc:creator>
<dc:description>An 84 d randomized block design using 96 beef calves (238.8 + 20.1 kg) in each of two years was used to assess the efficacy of energy supplementation and glucomannan (MTB) to alleviate tall fescue toxicosis. Groups of four calves were randomly assigned to 24 endophyte-infected tall fescue pastures (1.23 + 0.06 ha). Pastures of calves were randomly assigned to treatments: unsupplemented (CON), supplemented with soybean hulls (SH) at 0.33% BW (DM basis; LO), supplemented with SH at 0.66% BW (DM basis; HI), LO plus 20 g·hd-1·d-1 MTB-100® (LO-MTB), HI plus 20 g·hd-1·d-1 MTB-100® (HI-MTB). Calves were weighed and serum collected every 21 days. Fecal grab samples were taken from d 55 to d 59 and analyzed for dry matter chromium and ergot alkaloid concentrations. Tympanic temperatures were taken from one calf for 3 days each week from d 59 to d 84. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure in SAS with contrasts of effects of MTB, level of SH supplementation (LEVEL), MTB x LEVEL interaction, and CON vs. supplemented (SUPP). Treatments differed in ADG (P &lt; 0.01) with LEVEL affecting weight gains (P &lt; 0.01). Supplemented calves had increased weight gains compared to CON (P &lt; 0.01). Supplementation increased gain per hectare (P &lt; 0.01) and was influenced by LEVEL (P &lt; 0.01). Control calves excreted higher concentrations of ergot alkaloids than SUPP (P &lt; 0.01). Forage and total DMI increased as a result of supplementation (P &lt; 0.01). Prolactin levels differed among the treatments on d 63 and 84 (P &lt; 0.01) with increases attributed to LEVEL (P &lt; 0.05). There were differences between CON and SUPP (P &lt; 0.01) on d 63 and 84, where SUPP increased prolactin concentrations to twice that of CON. Tympanic temperatures were similar among treatments (P &gt; 0.05); daily maximum temperatures and diurnal range differed among the treatments (P &lt; 0.01). SUPP animals had lower maximum temperatures and decreased diurnal range compared to CON (P &lt; 0.01). These findings indicate that SH supplementation can lessen the severity of fescue toxicosis; however, glucomannan fed at the current level only affected tympanic temperature.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Development, Stability, and Molecular Mechanisms of Macrolide Resistance in &lt;em&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/em&gt;</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Caldwell, Dave Bryson</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Previous studies on macrolide resistance in Campylobacter were primarily focused on the isolates from various origins using in vitro systems. In this study, both in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to examine the development, stability, and genetic basis of macrolide resistance in C. jejuni. All in vitro and in vivo selected EryR mutants were derived from the same parent strain C. jejuni NCTC 11168. To determine if long-term exposure of low-level EryR C. jejuni to low-dose tylosin selects for high-level EryR mutants (MIC &gt; 512 μg/ml), two low-level EryR mutants (MIC = 32 or 64 μg/ml) were used to inoculate chickens at 15 days of age in two independent experiments. Total and EryR C. jejuni populations in swabs collected at different time points were determined by differential plating and MIC test. The in vitro stability was tested by repeated subculturing of EryR mutants in Ery-free broth medium. The in vivo stability was tested by inoculating 3-day-old chickens (12-13 birds/group) receiving nonmedicated feed with EryR mutants and collecting cloacal swabs from each chickens at 12, 22, 38, and 47 days of age. Total and EryR C. jejuni populations in culture (after 10, 20 and 33 passages) or swab were determined by differential plating and MIC test. Genomic DNA from each of 63 selected EryR mutants was used for PCR amplification and sequence analysis of 23S rRNA gene and ribosomal proteins L4 and L22. Mutation in CmeABC multidrug efflux pump was transferred to EryR strains to determine the role of CmeABC efflux pump in Ery resistance. Chicken studies showed that the length of exposure time to subtherapeutic level of tylosin is not a sole factor contributing to the emergence of highly EryR Campylobacter. Prolonged exposure of low-level EryR C. jejuni (MIC = 32 or 64 μg/ml) to tylosin did not select for highly EryR mutants. The low- level Ery resistance (MIC = 32μg/ml) was stable after 10 passages in vitro but majority of C. jejuni were sensitive to Ery after 20 passages. The instability of low-level Ery resistance was also observed in chickens as early as 9 days postinoculation and EryR mutants were rarely isolated 35 days postinoculation. However, high-level Ery resistance (MIC &gt; 512μg/ml) displayed remarkably stability in vitro and in vivo. All high-level EryR mutants selected in vivo displayed the A2074G mutation in 23S rRNA gene, distinct from the specific mutation (A2074C) observed in all highly EryR mutants selected in vitro. No mutations were observed in ribosomal proteins L4 for all in vitro selected EryR mutants but specific mutations in L4 (G74D or G57D) were widely found in low level EryR mutants selected in vivo (Ery MIC = 8-64 μg/ml). Insertion of three amino acids TSH at position 98 in L22 was only observed in mutants selected in vitro with Ery MIC ranging from 32-512 μg/ml. The CmeABC efflux pump worked synergistically with other mechanisms to confer Ery resistance in C. jejuni. Together, these findings indicated that C. jejuni utilize complex and different mechanisms to develop Ery resistance in vitro and in vivo.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Heat-Induced Perturbations during Oocyte Maturation Carry Over to Increase Susceptibility of Preattachment Embryos to Heat Stress</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bogart, Amber Nicole</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Objectives were to 1) examine effects of heat stress on maturing oocytes to alter the ability of resulting embryos to develop after fertilization, 2) evaluate blastocyst development of compact morulae derived from control or heatstressed oocytes after culture at 38.5°C or 41.0°C, and 3) evaluate effects of heat stress on compact morulae to alter sex ratio. Culture of cumulus oocytes at 41.0°C did not alter ability of presumptive zygotes (PZ) to cleave; however, the proportion of embryos that cleaved to the 8- to 16-cell stage was lower (P = 0.01). Also, the proportion of 8- to 16-cell embryos derived from heat-stressed oocytes undergoing compaction was lower (P = 0.01). Effects of heat stress to reduce compaction was without consequence on morphology, as quality scores of embryos derived from heat-stressed oocytes were similar to those derived from nonheat-stressed oocytes. Application of heat stress to compact morulae derived from nonheat-stressed oocytes did not affect blastocyst development. Also, blastocyst development of compact morulae derived from heat-stressed oocytes was similar to those derived from nonheat-stressed controls. However, if compact morulae derived from heat-stressed oocytes were exposed to 41.0°C, blastocyst development was reduced (P = 0.007). This effect was coincident with an increase in the proportion of degenerate embryos (P = 0.02). Temperature at which oocytes were matured did not alter sex ratio of resulting blastocysts. Rather, there was a tendency for embryo temperature to increase the proportion of male embryos that survived (P &lt; 0.06). Results described herein are significant as they not only clarify the extent to which heat stress during maturation reduces embryonic development after fertilization but are also informative of heat-induced perturbations that carry over to increase the susceptibility of resulting embryos to heat stress. With this in mind, results raise possible concerns about current practices of utilizing MOET in heat-stressed cattle with the intent of obtaining “developmentally-competent” embryos. Additionally, since it was also demonstrated that developmental competence of oocytes has an impact on the responsiveness of resulting embryos to heat stress, effort to clarify developmental competence of oocytes before utilizing in vitro derived embryos to improve fertility of heat-stressed dairy cows is needed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Challenges of Making a Blastocyst-Stage Embryo: Impact of Heat Stress &amp; Technical Factors Associated with IVP Procedures</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Peixoto, Estanislao</dc:creator>
<dc:description>It was hypothesized that technical factors associated with in vitro production (IVP) of embryos may influence rate of blastocyst development of oocytes matured at 38.5 or 41.0 C. To test this hypothesis, a retrospective meta-analysis was performed.  Simple linear regression was performed to analyze continuous variables and ANOVA for categorical variables. Interactions among factors and maturation temperature on blastocyst development were analyzed using dummy regression for continuous variables, and using a factorial treatment design and ANOVA for categorical variables. Month of collection was the only variable that impacted responsiveness of ova to heat stress. Independent of maturation temperature, variables that explained most variation in blastocyst development included technician, total number of sliced ovaries per collection, ova number placed per well of oocyte maturation media, oocyte collection time, bull ID, sperm concentration added to ova, and ova age at IVF. The proportion of 8 to 16-cell embryos at time of cleavage assessment was the best predictor of blastocyst development. Results of model selection showed that development of ova matured at 38.5 C was associated with size of the collection, while development of ova matured at 41.0 C was mainly associated with ova age at fertilization. When data for ova matured at 38.5 and 41.0 C were combined, the effect of number of PZ per well on blastocyst development became evident. Use of these findings for optimizing efficiency of IVP procedures would effectively reduce experimental costs related to embryo production and increase laboratory productivity.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Efficacy of Endo-Fighter® for Cattle Grazing Endophyte-Infected Tall Fescue Pastures During Summer and Early Fall</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Norman, Rebekah</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Two 84-day grazing trials were conducted (Aug 24 – Nov 17, 2006; Jun 14 - Sept 7, 2007) near Spring Hill, TN to determine the efficacy of Endo-Fighter (R), an ADM Alliance Nutrition, Inc. product designed to be fed to cattle grazing or fed endophyte-infected fescue or hay and Prototype, an improved version of Endo-Fighter (R). Tall fescue pastures with &gt;90% of pasture exhibiting infestation (E+), thus producing high concentration of ergot alkaloids in the grass, were grazed.
In 2006 sixty weaned crossbred heifers (325 ± 17 kg) (2007, steers, 267 ± 18 kg) were used in a randomized block design (2007, CRD), blocked by previous treatment and randomly allotted to pastures with four animals per 1.2-ha paddocks and five replications per treatment. Treatments were ADM Alliance Nutrition, Inc. mineral products: 1) Mastergain (R) mineral = Control; 2) Endo-Fighter (R) mineral; 3) Prototype mineral. Animals had free choice access to E+ grass, water and shade.
Heifers were weighed on d 0, 1, 28, 56, 83, and 84 (2006) and on d 0, 1, 22, 43, 64, and 85 (2007). In 2006 data collected were initial, d 28, d 56, and final weights, and ADG. In 2007 data collected were initial, d 22, d 43, d 64, and final weights, and ADG for each period. Blood serum was collected at each weigh date for prolactin analysis. Mineral consumption and animal grazing behavior were determined at 14-d intervals. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS. For all variables, contrasts were performed to compare Control to mineral supplements containing Endo-Fighter (R) or Prototype.
In 2006 total ADG (kg) and average daily mineral consumption (g) were: 0.61, 170*; 0.56, 122*; 0.50, 146; for Control, Endo-Fighter (R) and Prototype, respectively (*P &lt; .09). In 2007 data were 0.61, 134; 0.57, 147; 0.56, 116; for Control, Endo-Fighter (R), and Prototype, respectively. For both years, serum prolactin was not different (P &gt; 0.05) among treatments. Animal performance and prolactin levels were not significantly affected by the feeding of Endo-Fighter (R) or Prototype in these trials. However, lack of response to Endo-Fighter (R) and Prototype in 2006 may have been attributed to mild weather conditions. In 2007 lack of response may have been a result of extreme heat and drought conditions.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Functional Cloning and Characterization of Antibiotic Resistance Genes from the Chicken Gut Microflora</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Zhou, Wei</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A recent study using human fecal samples in conjunction with a culture-independent approach revealed immense diversity of antibiotic resistance (AR) genes in the human gut microflora. We hypothesize that food animal gut microflora also contain diverse and novel AR genes which could contribute to the emergence and transmission of AR in pathogens important in animal and human health. To test this, we examined AR reservoir in chicken gut microflora using a metagenomic, functional cloning method. Total genomic DNA was extracted from individual cecal contents of two free range chickens and two conventionally raised chickens. The DNAs were physically sheered into 1 to 3 kb fragments, cloned into expression vector pZE21-MCS, and transformed into E. coli TOP10 host strain, resulting in four metagenomic libraries of a total size of 108 base pairs per library. The AR transformants from the libraries were selected on plates containing the specific antibiotic of interest; six antibiotics including ampicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, spectinomycin, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin were used for screening. Plasmids from selected transformants were extracted and subjected to sequence analysis of inserted fragments. Identified AR genes were annotated and aligned with homologs that have been deposited in GenBank. A total of 12 AR genes and 3 AR genes were identified from the microbiome in conventionally raised chickens and free-range chickens, respectively. Of the identified 15 AR genes, 8 genes that confer resistance to ampicillin, spectinomycin or chloramphenicol shared low sequence similarity (58% - 76% at amino acid level) with the corresponding AR genes previously identified using culture-dependent approaches. Notably, among the 8 novel AR genes identified in this study, 4 genes also shared low sequence similarities (59%-76% at amino acid level) with recently identified AR genes in human gut.  An E. coli-Campylobacter shuttle vector bearing the flaA sigma 28 promoter was constructed. Two novel genes conferring resistance to ampicillin (FRAmp1.1) and spectinomycin (FRSpe1.1) were cloned into this new expression vector, respectively. The derived vectors have conferred increased AR in C. jejuni, a leading zoonotic bacterial pathogen causing human gastroenteritidis in many industrialized countries. Together, findings from this study showed the effectiveness of the metagenomic approach for examination of AR reservoir in food animals, revealed novel AR resistance genes in chicken gut microflora, and demonstrated the functionality of such AR genes in foodborne human pathogens.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Evaluation of chromosomally-integrated luxCDABE and plasmid-borne GFP markers for the study of localization and shedding of STEC O91:H21 in calves</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hong, Yingying</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) has been recognized as an important foodborne pathogen. Of this group, O91 is one  of the common serogroups frequently isolated from patients and food in some countries, with O91:H21 being previously implicated in hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Cattle are principle reservoirs for STEC, and studies examining STEC shedding in cattle often include experimental inoculation of strains of interest using antibiotic resistance markers for identifiable recovery. However, indigenous fecal microbes exhibiting similar resistance patterns can confound such studies. Such was the case in a study by our group when attempting to characterize shedding patterns of O91:H21 in calves, leading us to seek other, more effective, markers. Among our strategies  was  the development of a chromosomally integrated bioluminescence marker via transposon mutagenesis using a  luxCDABE cassette from Photorhabdus luminescens  and a plasmid borne GFP marker via transformation of the pGFP vector. The luxCDABE marker was inserted on host chromosome at a site that was 27 nucleotides before the stop codon of gene yihL and confirmed to have little impact on important virulence genes and growth rate with a very high stability. In contrast, plasmid borne GFP marker showed poor stability without the application of appropriate antibiotic selection pressure.  For calves  receiving luxCDABE-marked O91:H21, the fecal counts of the organismranged from  1.2 x 10 3 to  1.3 x 10 4CFU/g  at  two days post inoculation and decreased to 5.8  to 8.7 x 10 2 CFU/g or undetectable level after  two weeks.Intestinal contents  sampled  from various positions at day 14 post inoculation indicated that cecum and descending colon may be the primary localization sites of this O91:H21 strain. Compared to antibiotic resistance markers, the use of bioluminescence markers does not require  the  restricted pre-inoculation screening of animals.  The enumeration of  luxCDABE-marked O91:H21 from feces and intestinal contents was easily accomplished and confirmed reliable by M-PCR analysis under the presence of indigenous bacteria which cannot be eliminated by  antibiotic-supplemented selective plates. Therefore, the chromosomal integrated luxCDABE marker may be a better model for the study of STEC colonization and shedding in cattle.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Relationship of Intracellular Signaling Pathways with Migration in Bovine Neutrophils with Different CXCR1+777 Genotypes</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Loughery, Angela Pollock</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Prior research in our lab has demonstrated a significant association between the incidence of subclinical mastitis and neutrophil functions with polymorphisms of the CXCR1 gene in Holstein dairy cattle. The objective of this study was to evaluate the specificity of the response relative to CXCR1 and potential involvement of intracellular signaling pathways. Migration was evaluated in cows of both homozygous genotypes (n=7 each) in response to high and low doses of interleukin-8 (IL -8; specific for CXCR1 and CXCR2), epithelial neutrophil activating peptide (ENA-78; specific for CXCR2) or zymosan activated sera (ZAS; complement receptors). Cows with a GG genotype had significantly more migration in response to both 12.5 and 50 nM doses of IL -8 (p&lt;0.05) compared to cows with a CC genotype. Although a similar trend was observed for 50 nMENA-78 (p&lt;0.07), this was not evident with the 12.5 nM dose. This result was comparable to ZAS, where the 5%dose caused significantly more neutrophil migration in cows with a GG genotype than those with a CC genotype (p&lt;0.03), while the response to the 1% dose of ZAS was similar between genotypes. p38 MAPK and PKB phosphorylation were evaluated prior to and following stimulation with the high doses of each ligand. Relative increases in p38 MAPK phosphorylation were greater in neutrophils from cows with a GG genotype when compared to those with a CC genotype regardless of treatment with rhu-IL-8, rhu-ENA-78, and ZAS or not (p&lt;0.001), But CC cows had higher baseline levels of p38-MAPK phosphorylation than GG cows. Therefore, the lower increase in phosphorylation in neutrophils from CC cows may have been due to higher starting levels. Increases in PKB phosphorylation also were greater in neutrophils from cows with a GG genotype when compared to a CC genotype when treated with ZAS, but not other ligands. Because no differences between genotypes were observed at time zero this may be tied to the altered p38 MAPK pathway. Future research will be aimed at further elucidating the signaling pathways causing functional differences in neutrophils from cows with different CXCR1 genotypes.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Assessing Mitochondrial Activity in Embryos from Heat-Stressed Ova</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Nagle, Kimberly Ann</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Elevated ambient temperatures negatively impacts pregnancy rates in agriculturally important females. An oocyte undergoing meiotic maturation exposed to a physiologically-relevant heat stress results in alterations of developmentally important processes and reportedly decreases subsequent developmental potential after fertilization. To address problems of reduced competence after exposure to heat stress for the first 12 h of meiotic maturation (hIVM), Payton (2009) assessed the transcriptome profiles of oocytes and associated cumulus cells by microarray analysis and reported heat-induced perturbations at the molecular level in the oocyte. Specifically, 20 transcripts involved in mitochondrial function exhibited alterations in relative abundance of heat-stressed oocytes which coincided with significantly more ATP content at 24 hIVM compared to non-heat-stressed controls (Payton et al., unpublished). These findings of altered transcripts and elevated ATP production suggest heat-induced perturbations of mitochondrial function. To further discern whether these heat-induced alterations in mitochondria persists in subsequent embryos after fertilization, the present study measured ATP content in oocytes matured at 38.5°C for 24 h or 41°C for the first 12 h followed by 38.5°C for the remaining 12 h, resultant cleavage, and blastocyst-stage embryos. Results demonstrated a significant increase in ATP content in heat-stressed matured oocytes (P = 0.0148) and of resultant 8-to-16-cell (P = 0.0323) stage embryos but was not evident in blastocyst stage embryos. Here we provide information that heat stress alters mitochondrial function in oocytes which persists following fertilization, which may ultimately contribute to a reduced developmental potential of embryos from heat-stressed oocytes. A second objective was to validate microarray findings via qPCR of: 1) electron transport chain transcripts, COQ3 and NDUFC2, in the oocyte and 2) IHH of the Hedgehog Pathway in the surrounding cumulus cells. Results agreed with the previous microarray data (Payton, 2009) reporting heat-induced decreases of NDUFC2 (P ≤ 0.002) and COQ3 (P = 0.02) in oocytes and heat-induced increases of IHH (P = 0.007) in cumulus cells. While functional significance of these findings remains unclear, heat-induced perturbations at the molecular level in the oocyte are evident and may provide explanation for reductions seen in developmental competence of resultant embryos.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Bin-Cured versus Field-Cured Alfalfa Hay for Dairy Heifers</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Winton, Marshal C.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>INTRODUCTION:
This study was undertaken for the purpose of comparing the nutritive value of bin-cured and field-cured alfalfa hay, using actual feeding trials with dairy heifers.
Any study involving the production and preservation of more and better hay has great economic importance. Shepherd and others (21), in discussing the losses of hay from a national standpoint, state that:
The uncertain weather conditions that frequently exist while hay is being made, particularly in the humid sections of the country, are responsible for variations in the quality of the hay and for large losses of nutrients during harvesting. Conservative estimates indicate that losses during harvesting amount to l5-20 percent of the dry matter and 25-30 percent of the protein, under reasonably favorable conditions. Larger losses occur when rainy weather occurs during haying or when cloudy or humid weather makes it necessary to handle the forage considerably to facilitate drying.
Allred and Luebke (2) conducted a survey of haying practices in Knox County, Tennessee, in 1942, and found that losses of hay in the field and in storage were estimated at 4.8 percent of the value of all hay harvested. A survey made by Saville (20) in 1945 of 31 farms in Rutherford County, Tennessee, indicated that 37 percent of the first-cutting alfalfa hay was damaged to some degree by rain.
Shepherd (21) points out that in recent years much work has been done to develop methods of harvesting hay crops so as to eliminate the hazards of the weather, to reduce the harvesting losses, and to produce a higher quality feed.
This study was designed to test the comparative nutritive value of field-cured and bin-cured alfalfa hay. If the trial shows no significant difference in the nutritive value of the two hays, then the greatest economic value of bin-curing hay lies in the possibility of producing larger amounts of hay.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Improving Beef Cattle Performance on Tall Fescue</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Campbell, Brian Thomas</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The overall goal of the studies described in this dissertation was to improve beef production of cows grazing endophyte infected tall fescue either through management practices or through identifying markers for genetic selection. Experiment 1 investigated differences in spring and fall calving herds grazing endophyte infected tall fescue. This study determined that managing for a fall calving beef herd is the more productive and efficient system. This is due to increased reproductive efficiency as well as traditionally greater market prices at the time of weaning. A spring calving system will have faster growing calves, but the increased weight of the calves is not enough to offset the added value of more calves produced in the fall calving herd. Experiment 2 was a study to validate a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) as a potential genetic marker found on the DRD2 gene. Steers with an AA genotype at this SNP have been shown to have greater prolactin levels and this study indicated that cows which have the AA genotype will have their first calf an average of 23 days earlier than cows with the GG genotype. Also when allelic frequency was examined it was shown that spring calving cows had a shift in allelic frequency away from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium towards the A allele. Experiment 3 used a genome wide association study (GWAS) to confirm the presence of other SNPs that may be used as markers for resistance to tall fescue toxicosis in beef cattle. Twenty four SNPs were identified with nine SNPs associated with birth weight and 15 associated with weaning weight. Some of the SNPs are found within genes associated with production and carcass traits such as average daily gain, acid detergent fiber intake, marbling, and fat thickness. The results of this study are very promising but more research needs to be completed. The SNPs that have been identified need to be validated.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effects of environmental enrichment strategies on behavior and production performance of broiler breeder chickens reared at elevated temperatures</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Adeniji, Oluwatoyin Bukunmi</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Enriched housing systems are embraced as better alternatives to bare housing systems for table egg laying hens. However, attention is presently turning to the meat type (broiler breeder) laying hens. Hence, this experiment investigated the effects of perch structures and sharp sand on behavior, physiology, and production performance of broiler breeder chickens reared under elevated temperatures.
Two hundred and eighty eight broiler breeder females and 48 males (Cobb 500) at 21-weeks-old were assigned to their respective treatments in two different rooms. One room was maintained at 23°C to mimic a thermoneutral environment while the second room cycled between 23°C and 30°C to mimic a heat stressed environment. Each room had all four treatments and the treatments were replicated three times with 12 females and two males per replicate. The four treatments were sand (S), perch (P), a combination of sand and perch (SP), and control (C). Production performances (hen-day egg production, egg weights, floor eggs, fertility, and hatchability), Physiology (cortcosterone levels, heterophil/lymphocyte ratio), and behavior parameters were determined.
The production data were analyzed using a completely randomized design (CRD) with repeated measures while the physiology and behavior parameters were analyzed using CRD split plot with sampling and a factorial in the whole plot. The results indicate that S and SP increased (P=0.0138) egg production. Enrichment S, P, and SP reduced the occurrences of floor eggs. HS environment increased (P=0.0435) bird’s corticosterone levels in broiler breeder males and tended to increase (P=0.07) female corticosterone levels.
There was a trend (P=0.0792) for increased preening in the HS room. The birds in treatment P tended to preen more (P=0.0655) than those in S. The frequency of attempted mating was least (P=0.025) in treatment P. In the TN environment, broiler breeders reared in treatments S, SP, and C performed more (P=0.0029) completed mating than their counterparts in the HS room. The duration of sand use was higher (P</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Evaluating the Relationship between Ultrasound-derived  Carcass Characteristics and Production Traits in Angus Cattle</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Mayfield, William Michael</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Profitability in the beef industry is a crucial aspect of management schemes.  The overall aim of this study was to determine if carcass ultrasonography in replacement heifers could explain variation in traits such as reproduction, a major factor in beef cattle efficiency and profitability.  During a 10-year period, data were obtained from 906 yearling heifers through the use of carcass ultrasonography.  The measurements collected included adjusted values for ribeye area (REA), percent intramuscular fat (%IMF), rib fat (RF), and rump fat.  A retrospective analysis was performed on data collected and variables were separated into the extreme high and low 25% and the median 50%.  Analysis examined whether a relationship existed between reproductive traits (percentage calving at two years of age, age at first calving, first calving interval, lifetime calving interval) and carcass measurements determined by ultrasonography.
Age at first calving increased as ribeye area increased (Low REA 731.7±3.1 d; High REA 743.5±3.3 d; P=0.002).  Rib fat was also related to age at first calving as heifers in the high grouping were approximately 9 days older at calving (Low RF, 734.5±3.1 d; High RF, 743.7±3.2 d; P=0.008).  Expected progeny differences (EPD) for carcass traits such as REA also indicated differences between all three groups for age at first calving (Low REA EPD, 727.4±3.1 d; Med, 736.3±3.2 d; High, 746.2±3.2 d; P&lt;0.0001).  Observation of marbling EPD’s resulted in a difference of 10 days for age at first calving between the high and low groups (Low MARB EPD, 734.4±3.1 d; High, 744.0±3.2 d; P=0.002).  Interval from first to second calving (Low RF, 374.3±3.2 d; High RF, 361.7±3.5 d; P=0.014) and average lifetime calving interval (Low RF, 369.9±1.8 d; High RF, 362.8±2.1d; P=0.048) were both correlated with adjusted rib fat.  Evaluation of longevity (birth date to date of last calving) established that heifers with a higher carcass EPD for REA remained in the herd for an additional 7.2 months (Low REA EPD, 39.8±4.2 mo.; High REA EPD, 47.0±4.2 mo.; P=0.023).  Ultrasonography-derived carcass measurements and calculated carcass EPDs may be used as potential tools to predict reproductive soundness of a replacement heifer before being retained in the herd.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Angiotensinogen Gene Silencing Reduces Lipid Accumulation and Inflammation in Cultured 3T3-L1 Adipocytes</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Carroll, Wenting Xin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Obesity is characterized by metabolic complications which are related to several life-threatening diseases. Dysregulated inflammatory adipokines secretion from adipose tissue is believed as the major contributor to obesity-associated local and systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and other metabolic dysfunctions.
Numerous studies in our lab and others pointed to the role of local adipose tissue renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the pathogenesis of obesity, inflammation and insulin resistance. We hypothesized that adipocytes-derived angiotensinogen (Agt) played a critical role in adipogenesis and/or lipogenesis as well as adipose inflammation. To test, we established 3T3-L1 preadipocytes stably transfected with Agt-shRNA or scrambled sequence (Sc-shRNA). Transfected preadipocytes were differentiated and used to investigate the role of adipocytes-derived Agt using microarray and PCR analyses, as well as cytokine/adipokine profiling.
As expected, results confirmed that Agt gene silencing significantly reduced the expression of Agt and its hormone product angiotensin II (Ang II), as well as lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes compared to cells transfected with Sc-shRNA. Silencing of Agt gene also suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory adipokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α [alpha]), and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
Microarray studies identified several genes involved in lipid metabolism and inflammatory pathways which were down-regulated by Agt gene inactivation, such as glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (Gpd1), carboxylesterase 3 (Ces3), retinol saturase (Retsat), serum amyloid A 3 (Saa3), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 1 (Nod1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat1) and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (Cxcl12). Additional analysis using mouse adipogenesis PCR arrays detected lower expression levels of adipogenic/lipogenic genes, such as peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (Pparg), sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (Srebf1), adipogenin (Adig), and fatty acid binding protein 4 (Fabp4).
In conclusion, this study directly demonstrates the critical effects of Agt in preadipocytes differentiation, adipocytes lipid metabolism and inflammation. These results further support a potential role for adipose tissue-derived Agt in the pathogenesis of adiposity and obesity-associated metabolic complications.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Review of the Adults and Larvae of the Genus &lt;i&gt;Pycnopsyche&lt;/i&gt; (Trichoptera: Limnephilidae) with Revision of the &lt;i&gt;Pycnopsyche scabripennis&lt;/i&gt; (Rambur) and &lt;i&gt;Pycnopsyche lepida&lt;/i&gt; (Hagen) Complexes</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wojtowicz, John A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The adults and larvae of the genus Pycnopsyche are reviewed. Nineteen species are recognized for the genus. The males and females of all species are described and illustrated. All species accounts include description, diagnosis, type locality, distribution, variation, notes and material examined sections. The P. scabripennis complex is revised, and three distinct species are recognized (P. scabripennis s.s., P. antica, and P. conspersa). The P. lepida group (P. lepida, P. indiana, P. subfasciata, and P. virginica) is also revised with all species remaining recognized; however, P. virginica is removed from the complex. Two new species are described for the genus but will be named in a separate publication (herein identified as P. sp. A and P. sp. B). Keys are provided for all adults of both sexes. The larvae of sixteen species are described and/or discussed. A number of these were reared for the first time. Because of the conservativeness of larval morphology as a whole, many of the larvae can not be successfully identified below the level of groups of species. Keys to larvae are not included because of this difficulty. Known distributions of the species in the genus are updated utilizing information from published and unpublished sources. Maps plotted by county (U. S. records) or site (Canada records) are included. Finally, a preliminary discussion of phylogenetic relationships in the genus is provided. Based on this discussion the genus is modified from the five species groups of Schmid (1955) to a total of eight groups.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Adipose Tissue's Potential Role as a Reproductive or Lactation Endocrine Gland</dc:title>
<dc:creator>MacDougal, Megan Gray</dc:creator>
<dc:description>While adipose tissue secretes hormones related to nutrition and metabolism, a few studies have provided evidence suggesting a direct reproductive role from adipose-derived products. The goal of this study was to determine if adipose tissue serves as a reproductive or lactation endocrine gland. Adipose tissue was associated with the reproductive tract of mature female cows in two locations, mesosalpinx and mesometrium (tissues supporting the oviduct and uterus, respectively), in varying amounts. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction on a non-descript pool of cows, LHβ, CGA, PRL, FST, and LEP transcripts were demonstrated to be present in mesosalpinx, subcutaneous, visceral, and peri-renal adipose depots. Subsequent efforts aimed to determine the influence of adiposity on transcript abundance. Body condition score was used to separate cows into two adiposity groups, which were confirmed by adipocyte size. Adiposity did not influence the abundance of LHβ, but the CGA transcript was influenced by the adiposity by depot interaction. The PRL transcript was also not influenced by adiposity. The FST transcript was more abundant in BCS 3 cows, while LEP was more abundant in BCS 6 cows. Protein efforts utilizing an RIA revealed the presence of luteinizing hormone in all four adipose depots. Using an antibody against purified pituitary-derived prolactin, a band was detected in 6/9 mesosalpinx adipose depots similar in size to that observed in the pituitary. Presence of transcripts and hormones in adipose tissue provides the framework necessary for adipose to be a reproductive or lactation endocrine gland, though secretion would also be required. Secretion of such hormones by specific adipose depots could provide local effects to nearby tissues.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Seasonal Changes in White Adipose Tissue in American Black Bears (Ursus americanus)</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hill, Elizabeth Marie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>American black bears have an intricate seasonal physiology, eating an entire year’s worth of food in 7-9 months, and then losing that weight during hibernation with almost no activity. The black bear thus represents a novel model in which to study seasonal regulation of food intake and metabolism. What controls the seasonal changes in fat deposition and metabolism in bears is unknown. Adipokines, such as leptin, regulate food intake and metabolism, and we hypothesized that these adipokines vary seasonally in bear adipose tissue, in a manner that correlates with fat storage. The study population consisted of wild bears from the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP) and New Jersey and captive bears from facilities in Tennessee and North Carolina. Blood and subcutaneous fat were collected from all bears, and abdominal fat and liver samples were collected from euthanized bears. Body length and weight were measured and converted into a modified body mass index score. Circulating levels of triglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids, beta-hydroxybutyrate, leptin, and adiponectin were measured to assess lipid and glucose metabolism. A radioimmunoassay was validated for use in bears to measure serum leptin concentrations. Quantitative PCR was used to measure mRNA expression of leptin, adiponectin, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 4 (PDK4), and protein kinase, AMP-activated, alpha 1 catalytic subunit (PRKAA1) in the fat samples collected across seasons. Adipocyte size was measured as an additional index of adiposity. There were significant variations in body mass due to sampling lean bears in the GSMNP as compared to obese captive bears. PRKAA1 and adiponectin expression in subcutaneous fat were significantly greater in captive fall bears as compared to captive summer and captive winter bears. Circulating levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate were significantly less in captive bears as compared to wild bears. Circulating levels of leptin and leptin expression in subcutaneous fat did not change by season. Circulating levels of adiponectin were significantly higher in the fall as compared to summer and winter. Analysis of fatty acids revealed that cis-vaccenic, palmitic acid and stearic acids were prevalent in the bear. Correlation analyses identified significant relationships among adipokines, expression of metabolic genes and lipid metabolites.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>PATHWAY PROFILING IDENTIFIES MECHANISMS OF ADIPOSE DEPOSITION IN DOMESTIC CHICKENS</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ji, Bo</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The domestic chicken is an attractive, but underutilized, animal model for studies of adipose tissue biology, metabolism and obesity: 1.) like humans, chickens rely on liver rather than adipose tissue for the majority of de novo lipogenesis; 2.) quantitative trait loci (QTLs) linked to fatness in chickens contain genes implicated in human susceptibility to obesity and diabetes; 3.) chickens are naturally hyperglycemic and insulin resistant; and 4.) a broad selection of genetic models exhibiting a range of fatness are available. To date, however, little is known about regulation of adipose metabolism in this model organism.
Affymetrix arrays were used to profile gene expression in abdominal adipose tissue from broiler chickens fed ad libitum or fasted for five hours. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) was used to validate microarray results for select genes. A total of 1780 genes were differentially expressed in fasted vs. ad libitum fed (p&lt;0.05) tissue after correction for multiple testing. Gene Ontology and pathway analyses, combined with Western blot validation, indicated significant effects on a broad selection of pathways related to metabolism, stress signaling and adipogenesis. In particular, fasting upregulated rate-limiting genes in both the mitochondrial and peroxisomal pathways of beta-oxidation. Enhanced fatty acid oxidation in white adipose tissue was further suggested by a significant increase in tissue content of the ketone betahydroxybutyrate. Expression profiles suggested that, despite the relatively brief duration of feed withdrawal, fasting suppressed adipogenesis; expression of key genes in multiple steps of adipogenesis, including lineage commitment from mesenchymal stem cells, were significantly down-regulated in fasted vs. fed adipose tissue. Interestingly, fasting increased expression of several inflammatory adipokines and components of the toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathway. A second study with Affymetrix microarrays of Fayoumi, Leghorn and broiler adipose tissue revealed that genetic leanness shared molecular signatures with the effects of fasting. In supervised clustering analysis, fasted broiler chickens clustered with lean Fayoumi and Leghorn lines rather than with the fed broiler group, suggesting that fasting manipulated expression profiles to resemble those of the lean phenotype.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Differential Neutrophil Function and Intracellular Signaling in Dairy Cows with Specific CXCR1 Genotypes</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Rambeaud, Magdalena</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Mastitis continues to be the most economically devastating disease affecting dairy cows worldwide. Neutrophil recruitment to the mammary gland and neutrophil functional ability once there often determine whether a bacterial infection is eliminated or becomes chronic. A slow or ineffective neutrophil attack allows bacteria to continue their assault and generate a longer lasting and potentially more damaging infection. Since neutrophils are key players in the resolution of mastitis, and a polymorphism in CXCR1 +777 (G→C) has been associated with susceptibility to mastitis, the hypothesis of this research was that different CXCR1 +777 genotypes were associated with efficiency of in vitro neutrophil activity and/or IL-8 receptor expression and intracellular signaling. Neutrophil function (migration, adhesion molecule upregulation, survival from spontaneous apoptosis, glutathione levels, reactive oxygen generation and bactericidal activity) as well as CXCR1 and CXCR2 expression and signaling were evaluated in cows with different CXCR1 +777 genotypes. Cows with a CC genotype, which have previously shown increased susceptibility to mastitis, had decreased adhesion molecule upregulation and neutrophil migration towards IL-8 compared to cows with a GG genotype. Furthermore, cows with a CC genotype displayed decreased ROS generation and, paradoxically, increased survival from spontaneous apoptosis. In addition, initial observations revealed that overall IL-8 receptor numbers tended to be lower in cows with a CC genotype compared to cows with a GG genotype. However, in the presence of a CXCR2 inhibitor (SB225002), CXCR1 affinity was about 5-fold lower in cows with a CC genotype and this may have resulted in an underestimation of receptor numbers in cows with this genotype. Additionally, intracellular calcium ([Ca++]i) release was lower in cows with a CC genotype when cells were stimulated with IL-8 but not epithelial derived neutrophil attractant-78. When neutrophils were stimulated with an optimal dose of IL-8 in the presence of SB225002, allowing only signaling through CXCR1, [Ca++]i release was lower in cows with a CC genotype, suggesting decreased CXCR1 signaling in these animals, potentially due to lower CXCR1 affinity for IL-8. This research provides evidence for neutrophil functional differences and differential CXC receptor activity and signaling in cows with specific CXCR1 genotypes. Future research aimed at better characterizing CXCR1 and CXCR2 in the bovine as well as corroboration of these findings in an in vivo model may provide prospective ways to enhance or regulate neutrophil function in dairy cows and potentially increase their resistance to mastitis and other inflammatory diseases.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Supplementation of Purified Fiber to Tall Fescue Grass Hay Diets</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Blalock, Howard Martin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Experiments were conducted to define the degradation kinetics of purified fiber products compared to conventional feedstuffs. In situ analysis was conducted on soybean hulls, dried distillers grains, dried corn gluten feed, rice mill, wheat middlings, solka floc, oat fiber (200 and 300 series), corn bran, red and white wheat bran using nylon bags. In situ results determined oat fiber (300) and solka floc were most similar to soybean hulls and secondly to corn gluten feed. An oat fiber: solka floc mixture was formulated for subsequent experiments. The in vitro experiment consisted of alfalfa hay, soybean hulls, corn gluten feed, oat fiber (300), solka floc, and 60% oat fiber: 40% solka floc. In vitro DM disappearance was greatest for soybean hulls followed by oat fiber, corn gluten feed, and the fiber mixture. In vitro gas production was greatest for soybean hulls, oat fiber, and the fiber mixture. Subsequently six cannulated steers and six wether lambs were arranged in replicated 3 x 3 Latin squares to determine effects of supplementing purified fiber to steers and lambs consuming tall fescue hay on nutrient disappearance, ruminal kinetics, and N balance. Free choice hay was supplemented with 40% solka floc: 60% oat fiber at 0, 0.25, or 0.50% of BW. Steer forage intake and total N intake were not affected by supplementation. Total intake of OM, NDF, and ADF increased with supplementation. Ruminal and total tract OM, NDF, and ADF disappearance increased with supplementation. Ruminal and total tract nitrogen disappearance were not affected by supplementation in steers. In lambs, organic matter, NDF, and ADF digested in the total tract was increased with supplementation. Total tract N digestion decreased, however, retention was not affected. In steers, ruminal acetate concentration tended to increase, butyrate increased, and propionate not affected by supplementation. Ruminal pH increased with supplementation. Ruminal NH3-N concentrations decreased with supplementation, but a treatment x time interaction existed. These data indicate that in both steers and lambs supplementing tall fescue hay diets with digestible fiber increases ruminal and total tract fiber digestion without affecting forage intake or digestion of nitrogen while also increasing ruminally available energy.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Body Condition Score and Dairy Form as Indicators of Dairy Cattle Disease and Reproductive Performance.</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Dechow, Chad D.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The objectives of this research were to estimate heritabilities and correlations between body condition score (BCS) from various sources, determine the genetic relationship among BCS, dairy form, cow health and reproductive performance and investigate various models to analyze BCS and dairy form. BCS was obtained from herds using PCDART dairy management software and from linear type appraisals by Holstein classifiers. Cow health data was obtained from several herds recording disease treatments. Genetic evaluations for cow health in Denmark were also obtained. Reproductive data and yield data were provided by DRMS and AIPL-USDA. Heritabilities and correlations among traits were estimated with REML using animal and sire models. Random regression and repeatability sire models were compared. Fixed effects for all models included contemporary group effects, age, and days in milk (DIM) when available. Random effects were sire or animal and error. The heritability estimate of BCS from linear type appraisal was 0.22. The genetic correlation estimate between BCS from PCDART records and linear type appraisals was 0.87, between BCS and dairy form was –0.72 and between BCS and strength was 0.69. The genetic correlation estimates from random regression models between DIM 0 in lactation 1 and DIM 305 in lactation 3 were estimated to be 0.77 for BCS and 0.60 for dairy form. Higher BCS and lower dairy form were significantly correlated with lower milk yield, less metabolic disease and fewer days open. The relationship among BCS, dairy form, cow health and reproductive disease remained significant after adjustment for milk yield. The relationship between BCS and cow health and reproductive performance tended to be non-significant after adjustment for dairy form. Supplementing direct genetic evaluations for days open with evaluations for dairy form increased reliability of days open by an average of 0.06 for 19 recently proven bulls. Selection for lower dairy form or higher BCS will slow the deterioration of cow health and reproductive performance that accompanies selection for increased yield.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Inhibition of Direct Prostaglandin F&lt;sub&gt;2α&lt;/sub&gt; Effects on Pre-attachment Embryos Improves Reproductive Efficiency in Cattle</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Scenna, Fernando Nestor</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) has been shown to have detrimental effects on embryonic development, quality and hatching ability of embryos and pregnancy rates in cows. However, information about PGF2α receptor (FPr) mRNA and protein in the preattachment bovine embryo is absent in the literature. The first experiment was design to identify the period of time during in vitro embryo development that is most susceptible to PGF2α and to determine FPr mRNA and protein in bovine embryos. Prostaglandin F2α decreased development of embryos to compact morula, but had no effect on development to blastocyst. In addition, FPr mRNA and protein was confirmed by real time PCR and Western Blot analysis, respectively, suggesting that PGF2α is having a direct negative effect on in vitro development of bovine embryos by activating its receptor.
Discovery of FPr in bovine embryos allowed for development of new therapeutic strategies aimed at improving reproduction in bovines. Therefore, in a second experiment, the effects of a selective FPr antagonist, AL-8810, on in vitro development of bovine embryos was evaluated. The antagonist did not have toxic effects on development of embryos. Subsequently, efficacy of AL-8810 to prevent PGF2α effects on pre-compacted embryos was investigated. Results showed that addition of AL-8810 to the culture medium inhibited PGF2α effects on development to morula stage.
In a third experiment, embryonic development and gene expression of Na+/K+ ATPase α1 and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), two important genes participating in blastocyst formation and hatching, was examined after culture of in vivo-derived frozen/thawed bovine embryos with AL-8810, PGF, AL-8810+PGF, or Control. Thereafter, pregnancy rates of embryos recovered with medium containing AL-8810 was evaluated. Results indicated that AL-8810 inhibited negative effects of PGF2α on development of embryos; however, no differences in gene expression were observed. Furthermore, recovery of embryos with medium containing AL-8810 improved pregnancy rates following transfer to recipient cows. In conclusion, inhibition of PGF2α binding to its receptors on in vitro- and in vivo-derived bovine embryos increases embryonic development and pregnancy rates after transfer to recipient animals; respectively. These findings will likely increase efficiency of in vitro production of embryos and embryo transfer programs in cattle.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Evaluation of Methods for Detecting the Apramycin Resistance Gene in E.Coli Isolated from Cold-Stressed Swine</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Arnett, Debra Beth</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study was an attempt to locate the apramycin resistance gene in E.coli isolated from cold-stressed swine. Six pigs were administered apramycin for 14 days during a 150-day study and were exposed to cold stress in the form of an 8 °C reduction in recommended daily temperature. Fecal swabs were taken on eight different days for the recovery of Escherichia coli, and isolates were tested for sensitivity to apramycin. Plasmids were isolated from selected E. coli from each day of sampling and were electroporated into receptive bacteria to see whether those bacteria in turn would become receptive so that a resistant plasmid could be identified. Electroporated plasmids could not be recovered so AP PCR was examined instead to identify resistant plasmids. Fingerprints were made of all plasmids using two different primers. PFGE of DNA, using two different restriction endonucleases, was also performed. Profiles from AP PCR and PFGE were compared separately for similarity by eye and also by using a molecular analyst software program that creates dendrograms. No resistant plasmids were identified, the source of resistance could not be linked to a plasmid or plasmids, and the apramycin resistance gene was not discovered.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Comparative Anatomy of the Lower Respiratory Tract of the Gray Short-tailed Opossum (Monodelphis domestica) and North American Opossum (Didelphis virginiana)</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Cope, Lee Anne</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The present study describes the lower respiratory tract anatomy of the gray short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica) and North American opossum (Didelphis virginiana). The trachea of the gray short-tailed opossum consists of 25 c-shaped tracheal cartilages. The trachea of the North American opossum consists of 28 c-shaped cartilages. The right lung of both species is separated into cranial, middle, caudal and accessory lobes by interlobar fissures. The left lung consists of unseparated cranial and caudal lobes. The right and left pulmonary arteries of the gray short-tailed and North American opossums divide into pulmonary lobar arteries. The pulmonary lobar veins join to form pulmonary veins. In the gray short-tailed opossum, the pulmonary lobar veins join to form a right and left pulmonary vein which join to form a common pulmonary venous trunk. In the North American opossum, a similar pattern occurs however the common pulmonary venous trunk is formed from three pulmonary veins (right, left and middle). Vascularization of the lung parenchyma is via the bronchial artery, a branch of the bronchoesophageal artery. Right and left bronchial branches course along the dorsal surface of the principal bronchi toward the hilus of the lung. In both species, the left bronchial branch anastomoses with a mediastinal artery originating from the aorta. Cranial deep cervical, cranial mediastinal and tracheobronchial lymph nodes drain the lower respiratory tract of both species. Sympathetic innervation to the lungs of the opossums comes from the sympathetic trunks as thoracic splanchnic nerves. Parasympathetic innervation to the lungs is via branches from the vagus nerves.
The trachea and principal bronchi of the gray short-tailed opossum are lined by pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium. Bronchial cartilages are irregular, shaped plates and localized to the extrpulmonary portion of the principal bronchus. The secondary and tertiary bronchi and primary and secondary bronchioles are lined by simple ciliated columnar epithelium. The terminal bronchioles and proximal portion of the respiratory bronchioles are lined by simple ciliated cuboidal epithelium. The distal portion of the respiratory bronchioles and the alveolar ducts are lined by simple squamous epithelium. The alveoli are lined by type I and II pneumocytes.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effects of Management and Environmental Conditions on Antibiotic Resistance in Bacteria Associated with Swine</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Cullen, Patricia</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Weaned pigs (n=58) were challenged with nalidixic resistant Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium and separated into eight treatments to determine the effects of various environmental and management conditions on the development of antibiotic resistance among pathogenic and commensal bacteria. Apramycin sulfate was administered in the feed (150g/ton) two days postchallenge for a period of 14 days with the exception of one control group. Treatments included: control without apramycin (control-1); control with apramycin (control-2); and apramycin plus either cold stress, heat stress, overcrowding, intermingling, poor sanitation, and intervention with oxytetracycline (100 ug / ton). Treatments were applied 5 days post initial antibiotic administration and maintained throughout the study. Fecal swabs were obtained prior to antibiotic treatment (day 0) and on days 2, 7, 14, 28, 64, 148, and 149 post-treatment. Salmonella Typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis were isolated and tested for resistance to apramycin sulfate, ceftiofur sodium, oxytetracycline, and sulfamethazine via broth microdilution. Increased (P &lt; .0001) resistance to apramycin was noted in E. coli in all groups administered apramycin by day 14. Control-2 minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) returned to baseline following removal of the antibiotic, whereas cold stress, overcrowding, and oxytetracycline groups expressed significantly (P &lt; .05) greater MICs through day 64 before returning to baseline. S. Typhimurium generally displayed lower MICs for all test antibiotics compared to E. coli, while E. faecalis demonstrated elevated resistance throughout the study to all antibiotics. These data indicate that E. coli resistance to apramycin is significantly increased upon exposure to various stressors, whereas S. Typhimurium and E. faecalis may be less affected.

			<dc:title>Pathogenesis of Acid Injury in the Non-Glandular Region of the Equine Stomach: Implications in Gastric Ulcer Disease</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Nadeau, Jenifer Ann</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Forty-three horses were necropsied to determine if volatile fatty acids (VFAs)produced from fermentation of carbohydrates (acetic, butyric, propionic, and valeric acids) cause cellular injury which leads to gastric ulceration when exposed to the nonglandular mucosa of the stomach at pH 1.5, 4 and 7. In part I of the study thirty horses were necropsied to determine if acetic, butyric, or propionic acid could cause cellular injury. In part 2 of the study thirteen horses were necropsied to determine if acetic, butyric, propionic or valeric acid could cause cellular injury. In both studies the stomach was removed within one hour of death and dissected along the greater curvature. A 3 cm 2 piece of non-glandular tissue was mounted mucosal side up in an Ussing’s chamber. 60 mM of each VFA (acetic, butyric, propionic, or valeric acid) was combined with normal Ringer's solution and each VFA solution or normal Ringer’s solution was added to the mucosal side of the chamber. Normal Ringer's solution was added to the serosal side of the chamber. The pH of the mucosal solution was changed at 30 minutes to pH 1.5, 4 or 7 and exposed for three hours. The solution on the mucosal side was drained and replaced with normal Ringer's solution at pH 7.0 at the end of three hours. Spontaneous potential difference (PD) across tissue and short-circuit current (Isc) (current necessary to nullify PD = sodium transport across tissue) were measured every 15 minutes throughout the study. Percentage of control short-circuit current (PCIsc), resistance (R), and conductance (G) were calculated. At the end of the experiment, tissues were placed in 10% formalin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for routine histopathologic examination. In part I of the study, Isc was decreased (P&lt;0.01) and resistance was increased in tissues exposed to a low pH alone, as well as those exposed to acetic acid, butyric acid and propionic acid at an acid pH (1.5, 4.0). Tissues exposed to HCl only and acetic acid recovered to initial Isc values. Tissues exposed to butyric acid and propionic acid solutions did not recover (P&lt;0.01) to initial Isc values. Tissues exposed to pH 1.5 (33%) had the greatest percent (P&lt;0.05) of histopathologic change compared to pH 4.0 (28%) or pH 7.0 (25%). In part II of the study Isc was decreased (P&lt;0.01) and resistance was increased (P&lt;0.01) in tissues exposed to acetic acid, butyric acid and propionic acid compared to normal Ringer's solution at acid pHs (1.5,4.0). However, Isc and tissue resistance both decreased in tissues exposed to valeric acid. Also, valeric acid exposed tissues had lower (P&lt;0.01) conductance values than acetic acid, butyric acid, propionic acid or normal Ringer's solution exposed tissues. Valeric acid (42%), propionic acid (31%) and butyric acid (28%) had the greatest percent (P&lt;0.01) of histologic change. Normal Ringer's solution (26%) and acetic acid (18%) exposed tissues had the least percent (P&lt;0.01) of histologic change. PH alone and volatile fatty acids in the presence of acid pH of the non-glandular mucosa of the stomach causes cellular swelling that may lead to necrosis and ulceration.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Effects of Retinol during In Vivo and In Vitro Oocyte Maturation and Embryonic Development.</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Livingston, Tracy Elizabeth</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Previous studies demonstrated that retinol administration to ewes, followed by natural service, resulted in embryos with improved competence to develop in vitro.  In vivo studies with sheep and in vitro experiments with bovine embryos, were designed to evaluate the effects of retinol and to understand its mechanism(s) of action.
The primary objective of the first experiment was to analyze ovine oocyte metabolism, and to assess the effects of retinol on this process.  Sheep oocytes were matured in vitro over a 24 hour period in the presence of different radiolabeled substrates.  Results revealed that oxidative metabolism measured by glutamine showed no significant differences over all time periods.  Pyruvate oxidation was highest early in maturation and then decreased.  Glycolysis was highest at the middle time period.  Differences in metabolism between oocytes from retinol-treated ewes and those from control ewes were not detected.
Next, varying concentrations of retinol were added either during in vitro maturation (IVM) or in vitro culture (IVC) of bovine oocyte and embryos, respectively.  Our results demonstrated that 5mM retinol supplementation during IVM tended to improve embryonic development measured by the rate of blastocyst development.  This concentration proved even more beneficial if the control blastocyst rate was below 20%.  Furthermore, 10mM retinol appeared detrimental during IVC but not during IVM.
In the third experiment, we evaluated the effects of 5mM retinol and 100mM cysteamine on bovine oocyte glutathione content.  In addition, we investigated the combinatorial effects of retinol and cysteamine on in vitro bovine embryonic development.  We did not observe an increase in glutathione levels in bovine oocytes treated with retinol.  However, in the presence of cysteamine bovine oocytes exhibited an increase in glutathione content.  Retinol and cysteamine treatment during IVM and IVC increased bovine blastocyst development, which may indicate that retinol is increasing the utilization or uptake of cysteine from the medium.
Next, we evaluated the role of exogenous retinol supplementation to superovulated ewes on the glutathione content of mature oocytes collected from the oviducts.  Our results did not reveal differences in glutathione content of oocytes from retinol-treated ewes versus those from control ewes.  Antioxidant transcripts encoding for Mn-SOD, Cu-Zn SOD, GS, and GSTp, were detected in ovine oocytes matured in vivo. However, retinol did not appear to impact the expression levels of these transcripts.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Characterizing the Transfer of Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance Genes Across Generations of Swine</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Garner, Kimberly Nakia</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Sows and pigs were used to characterize the origin, transfer and persistence of bacterial resistance in swine. Effects of sow’s previous exposure to antibiotics and subsequent use of antibiotics in their pigs on antibiotic resistance of Salmonella enterica Typhimurium, Enterococcus faecalis, and E. coli were determined. Eight pregnant sows were divided into two groups, with four sows receiving oxytetracycline and four sows receiving no antibiotics. Fecal samples were obtained from sows prior to antibiotic exposure, and at 1- week intervals until pigs were weaned. Weaned pigs were challenged with Salmonella Typhimurium containing a nalidixic acid. Pigs from each sow treatment group were divided equally between a subtherapeutic antibiotic treatment regimen or exclusion of antibiotics. Pigs on the antibiotic treatment received apramycin at 150 g/ton of feed, beginning 7 days postweaning and lasting for 14 days, followed by oxytetracycline at 50 g/ton throughout the grow/finish period. Fecal samples were obtained from the pigs while on the sows and at 2, 7, 14, 30, 60, 114 and 115 days postweaning. The Salmonella challenge organism, E. coli and E. faecalis were recovered and tested against both apramycin and oxytetracycline using a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) analysis. Data were analyzed using the mixed models procedure of SAS. Polymerase Chain Reaction and transformation techniques were used to characterize genetic resistance elements and determine if the location of such gene sequences. Random apramycinresistant E. coli isolates (n = 110) were chosen from antibiotic treated sows and pigs, non-antibiotic treated sows and pigs and environmental manure to test through PCR, plasmid profiling, and macrorestriction analysis. Treatments affected antibiotic resistance to the greatest extent in E. coli, compared to Salmonella Typhimurium and Enterococcus faecalis. The greatest resistance to apramycin occurred in E. coli isolates from nursing pigs on sows that had earlier exposure to tetracyclines, and from pigs treated with apramycin during the postweaning period. Resistance to oxytetracycline was consistently high throughout the study in isolates from all pigs and sows, including those with no previous exposure to that drug. Genes responsible for apramycin resistance were found in approximately 90% of resistant isolates and their location was determined to be on bacterial plasmids. It was also determined that several different types of E. coli contained the aac(3)-IV gene responsible for apramycin resistance. These results indicate that apramycin and tetracycline resistance in E. coli was affected by previous use of tetracycline in sows (P ≥ 05). Additionally, subsequent use of antibiotics in pigs also affected (P ≤ 05) resistance levels in E. coli, whereas Salmonella Typhimurium and Enterococcus faecalis were not affected by antibiotic use in sows or pigs.

			<dc:title>Systematics, Distribution, and Biology of Fishes Currently Allocated to &lt;em&gt;Erimystax&lt;/em&gt; (Jordan), a Subgenus of &lt;em&gt;Hybopsis&lt;/em&gt; (Cyprinidae)</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Harris, John Lowrey</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Intra- and interspecific variation of species of the subgenus Erimystax, genus Hybopsis, are analyzed using multivariate statistical techniques. Diagnoses, descriptions, figures, supporting tables, and distribution maps are provided to facilitate identification of the subgenus and component species. Results of multivariate analyses support the elevation of the Ozark subspecies of Hybopsis dissimilis to specific standing as Hybopsis i. insignis distributed in the lower Tennessee and Cumberland river drainages and H. insignis eristigma found in eastern tributaries of the upper Tennessee River drainage. Populations interpreted as intergrades occur in the Clinch, Powell, and Holston rivers. Two subspecies of Hybopsis x-punctata are recognized with H. x. x-punctata occurring in the upper Mississippi, Missouri, Neosho, and Ouachita river drainages and H. x-punctata trautmani inhabiting the Ohio, Thames, and White (Arkansas and Missouri) river drainages. Missouri River drainage populations are possible intergrades, pending further analysis. Two species groups are recognized within Erimystax. These are the dissimilus species group, composed of Hybopsis dissimilis, H. harryi, and H. insignis,and the x-punctata species group, composed of H. x-punctata and H. cahni.
Phylogenetic comparisons among the subgenus Erimystax, Hybopsis monacha, and subgenus Cyprinella of  Notropis reveal H. monacha is an enigmatic species sharing characters with both subgenera. The exact phylogenetic placement of Hybopsis monacha is not known, but it is not considered a member of Erimystax.
Life history studies of Hybopsis x-punctata, H. harryi, H. dissimilis, and H. insignis were conducted and the findings are presented. Dietary analyses show H. harryi feeds primarily on periphytic detrital aggregate (PDA) and algae, whereas, the other species are more omnivorous and feed or relatively equal amounts of benthic invertebrates and PDA. Hybopsis harryi is the only Erimystax with a coiled gut configuration. The remaining species have a simple s-shape gut.
All species spawn over clean, gravel substrate during a three to four week period in April or May. Spawning may be initiated by a combination of rising water temperature and increased stream discharge. Males grow faster during the first 12 months of live but females are larger by the end of the second year. Females reach a larger maximum size and generally have higher survival rates than males. Maximum age recorded for each species is: Hybopsis harryi--42 months; H. x-punctata--32 months; H. insignis--30 months; and H. dissimilis--approximately 30 months.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Dynamics of Leukocytes and Cytokines During Experimentally-Induced  Streptococcus uberis Mastitis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Rambeaud, Magdalena</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Environmental mastitis is of increasing prevalence in well managed dairy herds throughout the world. Of the environmental pathogens, Streptococcus uberis is one of the most prevalent, accounting for a significant proportion of clinical and subclinical intramammary infections in lactating and nonlactating dairy cows and heifers. In spite of this, the pathogenesis of S. uberis mastitis is not well understood. The objective of this study was to determine dynamics of leukocytes and cytokines during experimentally-induced S. uberis mastitis. Five Jersey and 5 Holstein cows were challenged via intramammary inoculation with S. uberis into 2 uninfected mammary glands. One uninfected unchallenged mammary gland from each cow served as a negative control. Rectal temperatures, blood and milk samples were collected frequently for one week after challenge. Clinical status of mammary glands was recorded twice daily during milking. Milk samples were collected to enumerate bacteria and somatic cells, and to determine concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-8 (IL-8). Neutrophils were isolated from blood to determine expression of CD11b, CD18 and CD62 during the course of experimental infection. Sixteen of 20 challenged mammary glands developed clinical mastitis between 84 and 108 hours after intramammary challenge, and peak clinical signs of mastitis were observed at 144 hours. The number of S. uberis in milk from challenged mammary glands increased significantly (P&lt;0.05) by 48 hours after challenge, in spite of a massive leukocyte infiltration from the bloodstream, evidenced by an increase in the number of somatic cells in milk which began at 18 hours after challenge (P&lt;0.001) and remained elevated throughout the study period. Significant amounts of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-8 in milk were detected 66 hours after challenge (P&lt;0.05). Peak concentrations of TNF-α were observed at 120 hours after challenge, preceding peak clinical signs. Concentrations of IL-1β in mammary secretions fluctuated considerably from 66 to 144 hours after challenge, but were significantly higher (P&lt;0.01) than prechallenge values and values found in milk from control mammary glands. Similar to TNF-α, peak IL-8 concentrations were observed at 120 hours after challenge. The 4 challenged mammary glands that did not become infected exhibited an increase in somatic cells and IL-1β concentrations in a pattern that appeared to be similar to that of challenged infected mammary glands, but of lesser magnitude. Expression of CD11b was upregulated at 84, 90 and 114 hours after challenge (P&lt;0.05), and expression of CD18 was increased 20% at 48 hours after challenge (P&lt;0.05). Expression of CD18 decreased sharply 96 hours after challenge and remained depressed until the end of the sampling period (P&lt;0.01). Results from this experiment demonstrated that S. uberis experimental intramammary infection induced local production of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-8, which may play a role in the pathogenesis of S. uberis mastitis. Furthermore, an increase in somatic cells in milk occurred earlier than increases in adhesion molecule expression or cytokine production, suggesting that other mediators may be involved in initial leukocyte recruitment into the mammary gland after infection.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Effects of Dietary Additives on the Growth Performance and Occurrance of Resistant Bacteria in Weanling Pigs</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Pulliam, January Beth</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Three replicate trials, with a total of 36 ileal cannulated pigs, were conducted to determine the effects of including carbadox or mannanoligosaccharides in weanling pig diets.  Individual crossbred (Yorkshire X Landrace X Duroc) pigs were used as the experimental units and were weaned at approximately 21 days of age, balanced by gender, genetics and weight, and allotted to pens in groups of three. Pens were randomly assigned to one of four treatments including: AB) 55 mg carbadox/kg, BM) 0.2% phosphorylated mannanoligosaccharide, RT) a rotation of the above two treatments, or CT) NRC based control treatment with no additives. Pigs were allowed ad libitum access to water and the assigned treatment as a single-phase diet for a 35-day period.  Ileal digesta were collected on days 14, 21, 28, and 35 of the trial.  Pigs were sacrificed on day 35 and digesta and tissue samples were collected from the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and spiral colon.  Digesta were analyzed for pH, dry matter, total aerobes, total anaerobes, lactobacilli, streptococci, E.coli and VFA including: acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, isovalerate, and isobutyrate.  Tissue samples were fixed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined for villi height and crypt depth measurements.
Intestinal pH of the BM treatment was more alkaline and the CT treatment was more acidic when treatments were compared (P=0.0017).  A site effect (P=0.0001) was also observed where the ileum was more alkaline and the cecum more acidic.  Ileal dry matter increased (P=0.0007) for all treatment groups through day 28 postweaning and was lowest in the ileum and highest in the spiral colon (P=0.0001).  Lactobacilli concentrations were lowest for the AB treatment and highest for the CT (P=0.0400).  Time effects were observed where total anaerobe concentrations decreased (P=0.0034) 28 and 35 postweaning for all treatments and ileal E.coli concentrations decreased (P=0.0004) on day 21 postweaning.  A site effect (P=0.0001) was observed for all microbial concentrations.  Treatment effects were noted for ileal butyrate (P=0.0070) and acetate (P=0.0174) where acetate and butyrate concentrations were greater in the ileum for the AB and RT treatments compared to the BM and CT treatments.  Time affected ileal isovalerate (P=0.0113), butyrate (P=0.0001), and acetate (P=0.0001) concentrations.  A site effect (P=0.0001) was observed for all VFA concentrations. Treatment X site interactions were observed (P=0.0297) for valerate concentrations.  Villi length was significantly shorter in the ileum and crypt depths were deepest in the cecum and spiral colon (P=0.0001).
In a subsequent study to compare effects of carbadox and mannanoligosaccharides on performance, a total of 48 crossbred (Yorkshire X Landrace X Duroc) pigs were weaned at approximately 21 days of age and balanced by gender, genetics, and weight. Pens were randomly assigned to one of the four previously mentioned treatments with each treatment consisting of 3 pens and 4 pigs per pen. Each group was allowed ad libitum access to water and the assigned treatment as a single-phase diet. Pens were used as the experimental units. Performance parameters, including average daily gain, average feed intake, and feed conversion ratio, were measured for a 28-day period and compared across treatments.  Feed intake and feed conversion ratio were measured for individual pens.  No treatment effects (P&gt;0.05) were noted for any of the growth parameters measured.
Twelve pigs were sacrificed on day 7 and 28 and digesta and tissue samples were collected from the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and spiral colon.  Digesta were analyzed for pH, dry matter, lactobacilli, E.coli and VFA.  Tissue samples were fixed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined for villi height and crypt depth measurements.  Individual pigs were used as the experimental units and data were analyzed over time.
Treatment effects (P=0.0109) were observed on day 28 postweaning where pH was highest for the AB and BM treatments and lowest for the CT.  Treatment X site interactions (P=0.0333) were observed for percentage dry matter.  Site effects (P=0.0001) were observed for both pH and percentage dry matter.  Treatment effects were observed for E.coli concentrations on day 28 (P=0.0063) and over all days (P=0.0282).  Concentrations were lowest for the AB and BM treatments and highest for the CT treatment.  Treatment X site interactions (P=0.0313) were observed for E.coli concentrations on day 28 postweaning.  No treatment or site effects (P&gt;0.05) were observed for E.coli resistance to carbadox.  Resistance increased (P=0.0032) from day 7 to 28 postweaning for all treatments and sites.  Treatment X site interactions (P=0.0500) were observed for E.coli resistance overall.  Site effects (P&lt;0.05) were observed for lactobacilli and E.coli concentrations.  Treatment X site interactions were observed on day 28 for isobutyrate (P=0.0200), and on day 28 and overall (P=0.0001) for acetate concentrations.  Treatment effects (P&lt;0.05) were observed for valerate concentrations on day 7, 28 and over all days.  Treatment effects (P=0.0002) were observed on day 28 for acetate concentrations.  Site effects (P&lt;0.05) were observed for isovalerate, valerate, propionate, acetate, and butyrate concentrations.  Site effects (P&lt;0.05) were observed for villi height and crypt depth.
Results from this research indicate that the intestinal microbial environment is affected by the inclusion of carbadox or mannanoligosaccharides in weanling pig diets.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Soybean Hull Supplementation to Pasture-Based Beef Cattle Finishing Diets</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Pugh, Rebon Brent</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In the midsouthern United States, forages exist as the major nutrient source for grazing beef cattle. A large forage base allows this region to produce and market many feeder calves to backgrounding and feedlot operations. The utilization of forage resources stands as a high priority to cattle producers. Supplementation of highly digestible fiber feedstuffs can be used to enhance animal performance, to take advantage of forage resources, and to extend forages by increasing stocking rates or increasing hay production. The development of forage based beef cattle finishing systems may be supported by high-fiber energy supplementation strategies. The availability of feeder cattle and an abundance of forage resources in the midsouth increase the feasibility for producers to develop an interest in forage fed beef, niche market opportunities. The objectives of the experiments conducted were: 1) to evaluate two forage based grazing systems designed to produce cattle finished to a traditional endpoint; 2) to determine the effects of soybean hull supplementation on forage intake and site and extent of nutrient digestion. Experiment one was replicated over two yr and consisted of 42 crossbred beef calves (305.3 ± 12.8 kg) of moderate frame size used to compare two forage-based beef cattle finishing systems.  The calves were weaned each yr approximately twenty d prior to stratification by gender and weight, and allotment to each system. The cattle received no growth promoting implants or feed additives during the experiment. The two systems were: 1) cattle grazed on cool season perennial grass pastures and wintered on annual grass pastures (CSP+A) and 2) cattle grazed on cool season perennial grass pastures and wintered on stockpiled cool season perennial grass pastures with daily supplementation of pelleted soybean hulls at 1.0% BW on a dry matter basis (CSP+SH). There were three and four replications for CSP+A and CSP+SH, respectively. Each replication consisted of three steers and three heifers. Supplemented cattle were fed in bunks and all animals had free choice trace mineralized salt, access to fresh water, and sun shelter. The experimental grazing yr consisted of three grazing periods: fall, winter, and spring. Both systems were stocked at a rate of 4.9 calves/ha for each season with the exception of a winter stocking rate of 2.5 calves/ha for CSP+SH. The fall period consisted of both systems grazing cool season perennial grass paddocks. CSP+A cattle were then rotated to annual grass pastures while CSP+SH cattle were moved to stockpiled cool season perennial grass paddocks for the winter period. Hay harvested from CSP+SH experimental paddocks was fed to both systems when adequate winter forage was not available. Rotation back to the original fall paddocks occurred at the beginning of the spring period. The spring period lasted until the cattle were harvested. The mean of two consecutive d weights was recorded for the initiation of the experiment, each grazing period, and the end of the experiment. Corresponding to these weigh periods, ribeye area (REA) and back fat (BF) estimations were determined using real-time ultrasound. Twenty-eight d interval weights were recorded on cattle not withheld from forage or water, yet before daily supplementation to determine average daily gains (ADG) and to adjust soybean hull supplementation. Clipped forage samples were taken corresponding to every weigh period from five random locations (0.25 m2 x 2.54 cm) in each presently grazed paddock. Samples were used to determine forage quantity and quality. Masticated rumen samples were taken at the beginning of each grazing period from six fistulated steers equipped with rumen cannulas to determine diet quality selection. After 306 and 284 d (yr one and two, respectively) cattle were harvested and carcass data collected. The CSP+SH cattle gained 0.58 kg/d more (P &lt; 0.01) than CSP+A cattle (0.40 and 0.98 kg/d, respectively), which resulted in 171 kg more total gain during the experiment. The CSP+SH cattle were heavier (P &lt; 0.01) than CSP+A cattle at harvest (595.3 and 427.6 kg, respectively). CSP+SH cattle received an average of 1,139 kg/calf (DM basis) of soybean hulls throughout the experiment. Final carcass measurements indicated that CSP+SH cattle had a larger (P &lt; 0.01) REA and thicker (P &lt; 0.01) BF than CSP+A cattle (75.7 and 61.9 cm2; 1.00 and 0.25 cm, respectively). CSP+A cattle averaged a 1.4 yield grade (YG) and average Standard quality grade (QG), while CSP+SH cattle had a higher (P &lt; 0.01) YG (2.8) and QG (low Choice). The CSP+SH system resulted in greater weight gains with higher quality carcasses than CSP+A. In the second experiment, six steers (289 ± 2 kg BW) fitted with ruminal and duodenal cannulas were used in a crossover design to evaluate intake and site and extent of nutrient digestion of fresh clipped endophyte infected tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) pasture with or without soybean hull supplementation at 0.70% BW (DM basis). Steers were placed in metabolism units within an environmentally controlled room and provided with free choice access to fresh forage, water and a vitamin/mineral block. The spring growth of tall fescue was harvested daily for feeding during the experiment. Supplement was fed at 0700 just prior to feeding approximately 65% of the estimated daily forage. Additional forage was stored in a cooler and fed at 1900 to maintain a fresh forage supply. Experimental periods were 21 d with 15 d of adaptation and six d of sample collection. Chromic oxide (9 g) was dosed twice daily starting on d nine for use as a digesta flow marker. Duodenal samples were taken four times daily with times shifting one h each d to represent all h of a 24-h period. Soybean hull supplementation decreased (P &lt; 0.05) forage intake from 1.79 to 1.56% BW, but increased (P &lt; 0.01) total DMI from 1.79 to 2.21% BW. Apparent ruminal DM digestibility, 47.5%, was not affected (P &gt; 0.35) by supplementation. Crude protein intake was 107 g/d greater (P &lt; 0.04) with supplementation and duodenal CP flow for the supplemented treatment (782 g/d) was greater (P &lt; 0.01) than the control treatment (569 g/d). Duodenal microbial CP flow was increased (P &lt; 0.01) by 108 g/d with supplementation. Ruminal pH was not affected (6.5; P &gt; 0.17) and ruminal ammonia nitrogen concentration was decreased (P &lt; 0.03) from 3.7 to 2.3 mM with soybean hull supplementation. Total VFA concentrations (103.9 mM) were unaffected (P &lt; 0.15). Rumen fluid dilution rate and fluid flow rate were not different between treatments (P &gt; 0.60). Supplementation of soybean hulls at a rate of 0.70% BW to cattle consuming fresh tall fescue decreased forage consumption. Supplementation did not change the percentage of ruminal dry matter disappearance, but increased quantities of total tract nutrient disappearance. Also, the rumen conditions were maintained to support cellulolytic microbes and more N was converted to microbial crude protein with supplementation. The supplementation of soybean hulls in grazed forage diets improves overall diet digestibility, extends forage resources, improves animal performance, and provides an opportunity to produce a quality forage fed beef product.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Performance and Fertility of Yearling Beef Bulls Grazing Endophyte-Infected Tall Fescue Pastures</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Schuenemann, Gustavo Martin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>During a two-year study, 80 bulls and 80 steers were utilized to determine the effects of grazing endophyte-infected tall fescue on growth performance, semen parameters, endocrine profiles, and IVF. Bulls and steers were allotted to graze Kentucky 31 tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) infected with Neotyphodium coenophialum, an ergot alkaloid-producing fungal endophyte new stand (E+New; n = 20/yr), old stand (E+Old; n = 20/yr), E+Old plus ladino (Trifolium repens) and red (T. pratense) clovers (E+Cl; n = 20/yr), or Jesup tall fescue with the non-ergot alkaloid-producing endophyte MaxQTM (MaxQ; n = 20/yr). Bulls and steers were grouped by body weight (303 ± 13.5 and 290 ± 10.5 kg, respectively), breed composition, hip height, scrotal circumference (SC; 28 ± 1.6 cm), and age (296 ± 20.2 d) to graze assigned pastures from mid-November to the end of June (224 d) each year. Blood samples, ADG, SC and rectal temperatures (RT) were collected every 14 d. Hair coat score (HC) was measured at the end of the experimental period (June). Semen was collected every 60 d (January, March, May, and June). Scrotal temperatures (ST) were obtained by thermography before semen collection in May and June. Semen was evaluated for gross motility, morphology, and ability to fertilize oocytes in vitro (IVF). After motility and morphology examinations, semen was diluted with BioxcellTM extender and maintained at 4oC until fertilization of oocytes (26 h after semen collection). Oocytes (~850 / treatment) were matured for 22.5 h and fertilized with the identical number of motile percoll-prepared sperm for each treatment. Numbers of putative zygotes that cleaved and developed to blastocyst respectively. The whole experiment was divided into three different analyses for bulls (40 / yr) and steers (40 / yr) among all treatments pastures. Analysis II treatment pastures. Analysis III examined the ability of sperm from bulls (6 / yr) stage (including nuclei number) were evaluated on d 3 and 8 post-fertilization, optimal evaluation of treatment differences. Analysis I evaluated performance of evaluated performance and fertility parameters of bulls (40 / yr) among all grazing E+ and MaxQ tall fescue pastures to fertilize oocytes in vitro. Data were arranged in a CRD split-plot repeated measures and analyzed using mixed model procedure that included treatment, season, year, pasture (treatment), and all interactions as fixed effect. These procedures were used to compare differences among treatment for Analysis I and II. Time was a repeated measures factor and animal (treatment x pasture) was included as a random effect. Differences in individual least squares means were evaluated using LSD.
Analysis I : Bulls and steers grazing E+New, E+Cl, and E+Old pastures had increased overall RT (P &lt; 0.0001), increased HC (P &lt; 0.0001), and decreased prolactin (P &lt; 0.0001) compared to animals grazing tall fescue MaxQ pastures. Steers grazing E+Cl, E+New, and E+Old pastures had decreased ADG (P &lt; 0.0001) compared to steers grazing MaxQ tall fescue pastures. Moreover, bulls grazing E+New and E+Old had decreased ADG (P &lt; 0.0001) compared to bulls grazing MaxQ and E+Cl pastures. Analysis II: Bull performance on assigned pastures were reported previously in Analysis I. In addition, bulls grazing E+Old had lower ST (32.5 ± 0.4 vs 33.5 ± 0.4 oC, P &lt; 0.0001) compared to bulls grazing MaxQ pasture. Concentrations of testosterone, arginine, SC, and semen motility and morphology did not differ between treatments.
Analysis III: Data were arranged in a randomized block design and analyzed using mixed model procedure that included treatment, date, replicate, and all interactions as fixed effect. These procedures were used to compare differences among treatments. Replicate was included as a random effect. Differences in individual least squares means were evaluated using LSD. Percent normal sperm morphology (86.8 ± 3.8%) recorded at time of collection did not differ between pasture types. Motility at semen collection (72.5 ± 7.2 and 75.4 ± 6.5%), immediately prior to (48.7 ± 7.6 and 53.3 ± 6.7 %), and after (56.8 ± 5.4 and 59.9 ± 5.9%) percoll preparation was not different between E+ and MaxQ treatments, respectively. Semen from E+ bulls had decreased cleavage rates (73.5 ± 3.1 vs 84 ± 2.4%; P = 0.02) compared to MaxQ bulls. Development to 8-cell (85.4 ± 10.3 vs 82.3 ± 8.7%), blastocyst (32.4 ± 5.5 vs 30.1 ± 4.7%), and nuclei number (72.9 ± 4.8 vs 76.5 ± 4.5%) of cleaved embryos did not differ between treatments.
In conclusion, animal performance was affected by E+ consumption. However, motility and gross morphology of semen were not altered in bulls grazing E+ tall fescue pastures. Addition of clover to E+ pastures reduces the adverse affects on growth performance and scrotal temperature associated with fescue toxicosis. Moreover, semen from bulls grazing tall fescue containing the ergot alkaloid-producing fungal endophyte had decreased cleavage rates and may lower reproductive performance due to reduced fertilization ability.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Identification and Association of Bovine CXCR2 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms with Clinical and Subclinical Mastitis in Holstein and Jersey Cattle</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Youngerman, Sara Marie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Mastitis is the most economically devastating disease affecting the dairy industry. A genetic marker associated with inflammatory responses during mastitis could aid in selection for mastitis resistant dairy cattle. Objectives of this experiment were to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and resulting haplotypes in the bovine CXCR2 gene for two breeds of dairy cattle, determine SNP and haplotype frequencies, and identify genotype associations with subclinical and clinical mastitis. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood collected from Jersey and Holstein cows. A 311 bp segment located within the coding region of exon 3 of the CXCR2 gene was amplified and sequenced. Five SNPs were expressed in both breeds of cattle. Strong linkage disequilibrium was exhibited for both breeds among all five SNPs (P&lt;0.001). Four SNPs resulted in synonymous nucleotide changes, while one nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution (CXCR2+777 G→C) resulted in a GlnÆHis substitution at amino acid residue 245. Breed was shown to have a significant effect on frequencies for four of the five SNPs (P&lt;0.001). Ten haplotypes were observed from the five polymorphisms. Six haplotypes were common between the two breeds, while Holsteins and Jerseys each uniquely expressed two haplotypes.
We then examined the association of CXCR2 SNPs and haplotype genotypes with subclinical and clinical mastitis. Subclinical mastitis was defined as the presence of the same pathogen in at least two out of three consecutive samples obtained during lactation. Clinical mastitis was defined as the presence of abnormal milk, and/or an abnormal udder, and/or systemic signs of intramammary infection that warranted treatment with intramammary therapies and/or use of anti-inflammatory agents. A significant difference was detected between CXCR2 SNP +777 genotypes and percentages of subclinical mastitis cases in Holstein cows. Holsteins with CXCR2 SNP +777 genotype GG had decreased percentages of subclinical mastitis (~22%), while genotype CC cows had increased percentages of subclinical mastitis (~37%). In summary, results from these experiments demonstrated that the CXCR2 gene is highly polymorphic in Jersey and Holstein cattle. CXCR2 SNP +777 genotypes were associated with subclinical mastitis in Holstein cows, indicating that the CXCR2 amino acid 245 may be involved in cellular signaling and function during mastitis. However, with observed levels of linkage disequilibrium, other genes near the CXCR2 locus may also be involved with cellular functions during mastitis. This research is promising for dairy producers as this approach may represent an effective means of marker assisted selection for mastitis resistance and other inflammatory diseases involving neutrophils.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Reproductive Efficiency following Administration of an Inhibitor of Prostaglandin F&lt;sub&gt;2α&lt;/sub&gt; during Early Embryonic Development in Dairy Cattle</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Young, Charles Dexter</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A study was performed to examine the administration of flunixin meglumine (FM; an inhibitor of prostaglandin F2α) following artificial insemination on pregnancy rates of lactating dairy cattle. Jersey and Holstein cows (n=106) were randomly assigned to receive intravenously either FM (2.2 mg/kg BW) or saline (SAL; 1 mL/23 kg BW). Cows were randomly allotted to treatment by lactation number, bovine somatotropin administration, breed, BW, days in milk, milk production, and 305 ME milk production. Study was performed from September through April and all cows were milked twice daily. Following estrous synchronization (cloprostenol, 500 µg im), cows were artificially inseminated 12 ± 6 h after the onset of estrus was detected utilizing electronic monitoring. Administration of FM or SAL was administered 5 d ± 12 h following artificial insemination. Animals underwent verification of pregnancy 28-35 d following artificial insemination using transrectal ultrasonography by an individual blinded to treatment. Pregnancy was determined by the presence or absence of an embryo with a heartbeat. Pregnancy data were analyzed using CRD Mixed ANOVA Analysis. Administration of FM following artificial insemination did not improve pregnancy rates in lactating dairy cows (FM, 37 vs SAL, 31.4%; P &gt; 0.10). In conclusion, treatment with flunixin meglumine did not improve pregnancy rates when administered following artificial insemination in lactating dairy cows.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Milk Urea Nitrogen Concentration: Heritability and Genetic Correlations with Reproductive Performance and Disease in Holstein Cattle</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Mitchell, Rissa G.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The objectives of this study were to estimate the heritability of milk urea nitrogen concentration (MUN), describe the genetic and phenotypic relationships between MUN and reproductive performance, and estimate correlations among MUN breeding values and Danish breeding values for disease in Holsteins. Dairy Records Management Systems in Raleigh, NC provided lactation data. The Danish Agricultural Advisory Center provided breeding value estimates for disease. Heritabilities, genetic correlations and phenotypic correlations were estimated with an animal model using ASREML. Infrared (IR) and wet chemistry (WC) data were analyzed separately. Heritabilities were estimated with all lactations, as well as separately for parities one and two. Genetic and phenotypic correlations were estimated separately for parities one and two. Herd-test-day effects, age at calving, and days in milk were included in all models. Heritability estimates for WC MUN were 0.15 for all lactations, 0.14 for first lactation, and 0.09 for second lactation. Heritability estimates for IR MUN were 0.22 for all lactations, 0.22 for first lactation, and 0.23 for second lactation. Genetic correlations between first and second lactation MUN values were greater than 0.97 for both WC and IR. Genetic correlations for WC MUN and various measures of reproductive performance, including days to first service (DFS), first service conception (FSC), services per conception (SPC), and interval from first service to conception (IFC), were generally found to be not different from zero. The genetic correlation between WC MUN and days open (DO) in first lactation was 0.21, and between WC MUN and DO in second lactation, was 0.41, indicating higher WC MUN values were associated with increased days open. Phenotypic correlations were near zero for all measures. Genetic and phenotypic correlations for IR MUN and reproductive performance measures were not reported due to limited number of observations. Correlations among MUN breeding value estimates and Danish disease breeding values identified no significant relationships. Further investigations to identify possible non-linear relationships between MUN breeding values and Danish disease breeding values revealed no significant trends. While the results of this study indicate that heritable variation for MUN exists, the inability to identify significant genetic relationships to metabolic disease, reproductive performance, or foot and leg disease appear to greatly limit its use in selection for dairy cattle improvement in these areas at the present time.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with performance traits in beef cattle grazing endophyte-infected tall fescue</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bastin, Bryan Christopher</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum Schreb.) is the most prevalent forage in the Midsouth United States due in part to the presence of the endophytic fungus Neotyphodium coenophialum. The fungus, while conferring hardiness to tall fescue, contributes to decreased production efficiency in cow-calf operations. A previous genome-wide association study was performed using the Illumina 50k bovine SNP chip. Twenty-four SNP were found to be associated (P  &lt; 0.05) with adjusted birth weight and adjusted 205-day weights of calves from 48 beef cows at Ames Plantation. The first objective was to validate each SNP by testing associations with several additional phenotypes. Custom Taqman genotyping assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were subsequently designed to genotype each SNP in beef cattle located at Tennessee Tech University (n = 654), to validate associations in a large, independent herd. The results yielded 15 associations that were significant (P &lt; 0.05) with 6 phenotypes linked to those affected by fescue toxicosis. The second objective investigated the link between fescue toxicosis and the XK, Kell blood group complex subunit-related, member 4 (XKR4) gene. Serum prolactin concentrations were significant (P = 0.0002) for an intronic SNP within the gene, suggesting further investigation into the physiological function of the gene as well as providing a potential genetic marker for selection for cattle resistant to fescue toxicosis. The results of this study validate the majority of findings from the GWAS and provide effective initial steps towards utilizing genetic markers to improve the resistance to fescue toxicosis in cattle.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Preservation of Nutrients in Cool- and Warm-Season Forages At Different Stages of Maturity and Management</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Shultz, Jason Allen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The overall goals of the studies described in this thesis were to investigate management practices of tall fescue and native warm-season grasses (NWSG) and find the best time to harvest and method to preserve forage quality. Study one investigated the effects of maturity on tall fescue and switchgrass and the effects of preservation method on forage quality. This study confirmed that maturity reduced forage quality in both tall fescue and switchgrass. Both tall fescue and switchgrass were successfully preserved as haylage or hay and did not differ in forage quality. Forages harvested before mid-May met the TDN and CP requirements for winter feeding in both spring- and fall-calving herds. Feeding tall fescue from mid-May harvest to stocker cattle would result in a gain 0.45 kg/day based on TDN provided. However, switchgrass from the same harvests would result in stockers gaining 0.63 kg/day. Study two investigated the effects of multiple harvests, N fertilization, forage species, and preservation methods on NWSG quality and biomass production. Neither fertilization nor species had an effect on forage quality or biomass production. June harvested NWSG had similar forage quality regardless of preservation methods. Biomass production from switchgrass was reduced by a summer forage harvest, but a big bluestem/indiangrass mix stand was not. However, a June forage harvest paired with a biomass harvest resulted in greater yearly yields. Study three investigated the effects of treating and ensiling mature switchgrass with alkali on forage harvested in October and November. The October harvest had decreased NDF content when treated with alkali. Concentrations of at least three g of alkali treatment per 100 g of forage DM reduced NDF content, which could potentially improve forage intake. The results of these studies are promising and provide forage and livestock producers needed information on timing of harvest and preservation methods. However, more research needs to be completed to determine the ideal preservation method of cool- and warm-season grasses based on a cost benefit analysis in regards to the preservation of nutrients in forages and the ability to meet cattle requirements.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Identification of bile salt hydrolase inhibitors, the promising alternative to antibiotic growth promoters to enhance animal production</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Smith, Katie Rose</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Currently there is a global trend to eliminate the use of antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) in animal production due to the risk of creating reservoirs of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Previous studies have shown that the ability of AGP to promote growth is highly correlated with a decrease in the activity of bile salt hydrolase (BSH), an enzyme produced by commensal bacteria and whose actions may compromise host lipid metabolism; thus, BSH inhibitors could be a novel AGP alternative. In this study, a recombinant bile salt hydrolase (rBSH) from Lactobacillus salivarius was produced in an E. coli expression system, purified, and enzymatically characterized. Purification by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity chromatography consistently yielded approximately 15 mg of rBSH per liter of induced culture. A standard 2-step BSH activity assay which estimates the amount of amino acids liberated from conjugated bile acids was used to determine substrate specificity of the BSH and the effect of pH, temperature, and dietary compounds on BSH activity. The rBSH displayed its highest hydrolysis activity for glycochenodeoxycholic acid although there was no preference among other substrates tested. Optimal activity was observed between pH of 5.0 and 6.0 and between temperatures of 35°C to 55°C. Preliminary assays identified different dietary compounds that were potent inhibitors, including copper and zinc compounds which have previously been shown to boost feed efficiency and promote growth of poultry and swine. Furthermore, a high-throughput screening system (HTS) was developed for fast and efficient identification of potent BSH inhibitors. This HTS system was utilized to screen a compound library comprised of 2,240 biologically active and structurally diverse compounds. The pilot screen led to 107 hits and a preliminary review of biochemical information of the corresponding compounds further narrowed down those of interest. Several lead compounds have been validated by the standard 2-step BSH activity assay and will be subjected to future in vivo analysis in a large-scale animal study. Overall, this study characterized a BSH with broad substrate specificity and developed and validated different strategies for identification of BSH inhibitors, the promising alternatives to AGP for enhancing the productivity and sustainability of food animals.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Steer Performance and Forage Productivity from Tall Fescue Pastures  Grazed at Two Stocking Rates</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Stewart, Autumn Nicole</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Tall fescue, Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) Darbysh., is the predominate pasture grass in the mid-south region of the United States. The most dominant cultivar of tall fescue in the region is Kentucky-31. Kentucky-31 is infected with an endophytic fungus Neotyphodium coenophialum (Morgan-Jones and Gams), which is responsible for the cultivar’s drought tolerance, persistence under stressful conditions, and adaptation to multiple soil types. However, the endophyte is also responsible for producing toxic alkaloids that cause tall fescue toxicosis. Symptoms of fescue toxicosis are retention of winter hair coat, elevated body temperature, increased respiratory rate, reduced average daily gain (ADG), lower serum prolactin levels, and reduced reproductive performance. Four approaches proposed to reduce or eliminate tall fescue toxicosis are to use endophyte-free cultivars, dilute the toxins, dietary supplementation, or switch to novel endophyte cultivars. In this study, Jesup MaxQ, a novel endophyte-infected tall fescue, was investigated at two stocking rates at Blount Livestock Unit of the East Tennessee Research and Education Center. Tall fescue was renovated with white clovers to evaluate the persistence of the clover cultivars and to investigate the interactions of clovers with Kentucky-31 and Jesup MaxQ. Both fescue cultivars were grazed at different stocking rates to provide information needed by beef producers desiring to optimize animal performance. In addition, animal performance was measured for beef steers grazing tall fescue cultivars with and without toxic endophytes. Differences in stocking rate were not found in this study. Patriot clover was more persistent that Regal clover in Ky-31 E+ tall fescue. Animal performance was similar when steers grazed Jesup MaxQ and endophyte-free tall fescue and superior to those grazing endophyte-infected tall fescue. Steers grazing E+ tall fescue exhibited the typical performance, hair scores, and prolactin levels found when cattle are experiencing tall fescue toxicosis</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effect of choline or betaine supplementation on broilers exposed to different temperature treatments</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Summers, Joseph D.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this study, we looked at the effects of supplemental choline or betaine on broiler performance under different temperature conditions. In total there were eighty pens containing ten birds each for a total of 800 Cobb MX™ X Cobb 500™ (Cobb-Vantress, Incorporated, Siloam Springs, AR, USA). Each pen was randomly assigned to one of five dietary treatments in this study: Treatment 1, basal diet, Treatment 2, basal diet plus 500 methyl equivalents added choline, Treatment 3, basal diet plus 1000 methyl equivalents added choline, Treatment 4, basal diet plus 500 methyl equivalents added betaine, and Treatment 5 basal diet plus 1000 methyl equivalents added betaine. The pens were divided equally into two rooms. One room was assigned a treatment classified as thermoneutral (TN) while the second room was designated as high temperature (HT). Dietary treatments did not significantly impact performance (p&gt;0.05), but temperature treatments did have a negative effect on feed intake and feed to gain conversion during days 21 through 42 (p &lt; 0.05). The lack of effect found during this study may have been due to variance in the anticipated feed composition and the actual feed composition. The feed fed during this study contained more methionine, an amino acid known to minimize supplemental choline effects, than what was anticipated. This study showed that high temperatures have a negative impact on performance, and since our dietary treatments were high in methionine, it is still not known whether choline or betaine supplementation, above recommended amounts, to a broiler ration is beneficial or not.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Distribution of the Fishes of The Great Smoky Mountains National Park</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Simbeck, Damien J.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Over 200 collections of fishes have been made within the boundaries of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, revealing a Park ichthyofauna of 74 native and 5 introduced fish species. Abrams Creek, containing the most diverse ichthyofauna in the park, currently contains only 35 of its historical 67 fish species. This loss of species resulted from intentional poisoning of eh creek to improve habitat for rainbow trout and impoundment of the lowest 2.6 miles by Chilhowee Reservoir.
Abrams Creek also contains a very unusual ichthyofauna in its upper portion. Several species found above its 25-foot waterfall have not been found below it, and some are rare elsewhere in the Little Tennessee River system. A possible drainage history, supported by both ichthyological and geological data is theorized. Outlets for some of the streams now in the upper Abrams Creek system may have existed toward Little River and Parsons Branch or Tabcat Creek.
Possible environmental problems which might be faced by the Park's fishes are discussed. Although the streams in the Park are not subjected to problems such as waste water treatment or agricultural runoff, they are effected by such problems as acid rain and the possibility of global warming.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Distribution of Fishes and Changes in Biotic Integrity in the New River, Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Evans, R. Brian</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Electrofishing samples of fishes were obtained from forty-two localities in the New River system, Tennessee during summer and fall 1996. Eight of forty-two species collected represent new records from the New River: Notropis telescopus, Moxostoma macrolepidotum breviceps, M. carinatum, Lepomis auritus, L. gulosus, L. microlophus, Etheostoma cinereum, and Stizostedion vitreum. Temporal changes in the distribution of fishes were detected by comparing historical collection records with fish samples from 1996. Older records were also employed in the compilation of a modified index of biotic integrity (IBI) that was used to assess changes in fish assemblage health during the past twenty years. Positive changes in the distribution of fishes and the IBI indicate that water quality and fish assemblages have improved in the New River over the past two decades, subsequent to federal legislation that required decreased input of sediment and mine drainage into the Big South Fork of the Cumberland River system.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Temporal Relationships Between Plasma Cortisol, Corticosteroid-binding Globulin (CBG), and the Free Cortisol Index (FCI) in Pigs</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Adcock, Rebecca Jackson</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The free fraction of cortisol in circulation is that which is biologically available to cells. In swine, more than 60% of cortisol is bound to its carrier glycoprotein, porcine corticosteroid-binding globulin (pCBG). The Free Cortisol Index (FCI), which is the ratio of total cortisol to CBG concentrations, has been shown in humans to correlate well with free cortisol. In experiment one, the relationship between plasma free cortisol and the free cortisol index (FCI) was evaluated in 8-wk old pigs over a 24 h period and in response to the administration of saline (n = 4) and ACTH (n = 4). A high (P &lt; 0.001) correlation was found between actual free cortisol and the FCI in both saline (r = 0.73) and ACTH (r = 0.85) treated pigs. A diurnal rhythm was apparent for total cortisol, free cortisol, percent free cortisol, pCBG and FCI with higher values for total cortisol and the FCI occurring in the morning compared to lower pCBG values at that time. For the variables of total cortisol (P &lt; 0.05), free cortisol (P &lt; 0.05), and FCI (P &lt; 0.01), values were elevated during the four hours following administration of ACTH. Concentrations of pCBG differed (P &lt; 0.001) over time and were higher (P &lt; 0.01) for ACTH treated pigs over the 24 h period. In the second study, changes in plasma cortisol, pCBG and the FCI were examined in pigs in response to adrenal stimulation or suppression. Twenty-four 8-wk old pigs allotted in equal numbers, were administered ACTH, dexamethasone, or saline, and blood samples collected every 15 min over a 6 h period. In pigs treated with ACTH, the FCI increased (P &lt; 0.001) in a fashion similar to that of total cortisol, while pCBG values remained stable. In dexamethasone treated pigs, both FCI and total cortisol decreased (P &lt; 0.001) with a subsequent elevation in pCBG concentrations. The results of these two studies affirm the contention that FCI is a suitable estimate of free cortisol in swine, and that a better illustration of the temporal relationships between plasma total cortisol and pCBG may be assessed by the measurement of both.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Ruminal Responses in Cattle Grazing Tall Fescue Pastures Differing in Endophyte Level</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Corrigan, Alison Marie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Three 1.2-ha tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea, Schreb.) pastures at the Blount Livestock Unit of the Knoxville Experiment Station containing 1) Kentucky-31 endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum) infected tall fescue (KY-31/E+), 2) Jesup endophyte-free tall fescue (Jesup/E-), or 3) Jesup infected with a non-ergot alkaloid producing endophyte tall fescue (Jesup/MaxQTM) were grazed. The objectives of this experiment were: 1) to validate endophyte status of the experimental pasture through determining ergovaline levels of masticate samples and animal response using serum prolactin concentrations, weight gain, and rectal temperatures, 2) to compare weight and composition of rumen contents of cannulated beef steers grazing tall fescue pastures that differ in endophyte status, 3) to determine the effect of time of grazing on the in situ and in vitro nutrient disappearance of commonly used supplemental feedstuffs, and 4) to compare nutrient composition of rumen content to masticate sampling of the pastures.
Two ruminally cannulated steers were randomly assigned to each pasture treatment in early May 2003. After an 18-day acclimation period, steers were subjected to four 0700 and four 1900 rumen evacuations, where contents were weighed and sub-sampled for DM, NDF, ADF, and CP analyses. After rumens were evacuated and washed, steers were returned to their respective pastures to graze for about 45 minutes. Masticate samples were collected from the rumen for determination of pasture forage quality. Between evacuation days, in situ degradation of dehydrated alfalfa hay, corn grain, corn gluten feed, and soybean hulls was performed by placing five of substrates into 10x20 cm Dacron bags and incubating them in the rumen of steers grazing the forage treatments. Samples were incubated for 12 h, from 0700-1900 and from 1900-0700, to evaluate differences in day and night ruminal environments. Samples incubated in situ were analyzed for DM, NDF, ADF, and CP disappearance. Steers gained less (P &lt; 0.05) weight while consuming KY-31/E+ tall fescue than Jesup/E- or Jesup/MaxQ. The ADG for KY-31/E+ was 0.29 kg/d (P &lt; 0.05), while Jesup/E- and Jesup/MaxQ were 0.65 kg/d and 0.70 kg/d, respectively. Serum prolactin levels were significantly reduced in steers grazing KY-31/E+ compared to steers grazing Jesup/E- or Jesup/MaxQ. Rumen DM contents for steers grazing Jesup/E- or Jesup/MaxQ were greater (P &lt; 0.05) than steers grazing KY-31/E+ and 1900 content weights were greater than 0700 content weights, indicating that steers consume more forage during the day than overnight. Rumen contents were compared to masticate samples to determine if rumen samples could be used to evaluate forage quality. There were significant (P &lt; 0.05) differences between the two sampling methods. Therefore, rumen content sampling should not be used in place of masticate sampling to evaluate forage quality. Steer rectal temperature was higher (P &lt; 0.05) at 1900 in steers consuming KY-31/E+ compared to Jesup/E- or Jesup/MaxQ. In situ DM, NDF, ADF, and CP disappearance of corn grain was greater (P &lt; 0.05) in steers grazing Jesup/E- and Jesup/MaxQ than in steers grazing KY-31/E+. In situ alfalfa hay and corn gluten feed DM, NDF, and ADF disappearance tended (P &lt; 0.15) to be greater in steers grazing Jesup/E- and Jesup/ MaxQ than in steers grazing KY-31/E+. Soybean hull disappearance was not affected by endophyte status of pastures. Degradation of substrates was not affected by time of day of incubation.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Occurrence of Antibiotic Resistance in Environmental and Amphibian E. coli Isolates Associated with Cattle and Aquatic Environments</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Cissell, Robin Lynn</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The widespread use of antibiotics in human medicine and livestock production has been linked to an increase in resistant bacteria, which may carry transferable resistance factors, including integrons. Foodborne pathogens, such as Escherichia coli and salmonella, commonly reside in livestock, including cattle, and these pathogens may acquire resistance genes as a result of routine antibiotic use. As cattle are often located in close proximity to aquatic environments, they may disperse antibiotic resistant pathogens into such environments, which may lead to contamination of aquatic wildlife. We hypothesize that class 1 integrons and/or antibiotic resistant bacteria occur more frequently in environments with cattle exposure, and resistance and class 1 integrons disperse into aquatic environments and wildlife, which in turn provides a reservoir of antibiotic resistant bacteria for cattle within that environment. We investigated the prevalence of resistance genes and class 1 integrons in  E. coli from selected amphibian species from ponds within and adjacent to cow-calf beef production systems. Escherichia coli were isolated from bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) and green frog (Rana clamitans) tadpoles, green frog metamorphs, cow manure, and pond water samples within each livestock system in an attempt to determine if transfer of resistant bacteria occurs. Integron prevalence within E. coli was determined by multi-plex PCR. Antibiotic resistance to tetracyclines, florfenicol, and sulfisoxazole were determined using standard microdilution broth Minimum Inhibitory Concentration technique. A selected subset of bacteria was analyzed for resistance patterns using the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (N.A.R.M.S.). Class 1 integrons were detected in 3% of isolates (n = 63) from pond water and in 1% of isolates (n = 123) from cow manure. Integrons were not detected in isolates (n = 1014) from tadpoles or metamorphs. Tadpole samples with isolates resistant to tetracycline, florfenicol and sulfisoxazole were more prevalent (P=0.0001, P = 0.006 and P=0.0156 respectively) from cattle-accessible ponds compared to cattle-excluded ponds. The percentage of pond water samples with tetracycline resistant E. coli isolates was also greater in cattle-accessible ponds (P = 0.0283) compared to isolates from cattle-excluded ponds. Antimicrobial resistance patterns were observed to differ between treatments. Information from this study will provide key information for the development of strategies to reduce the prevalence and risk of antibiotic resistant organisms.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Expression During the Estrous Cycle and Early Pregnancy</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ochs, Gregory Joseph</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Acute control of prostaglandin production is essential for normal estrous cyclicity and maintenance of early pregnancy. The rate limiting step for prostaglandin production is the activation of Phospholipase A2. There are many phospholipase A2s, but few have been investigated in reproductive studies. The objective of this study was to examine PLA2 Groups IV and VI protein and mRNA expression in the uterine endometrium during the estrous cycle and early pregnancy in ewes. Ewes were monitored for estrous and uterine tissues were collected surgically on days 5 (n=3), 10(n=3) and 15(n=3) of the estrous cycle. Endometrium from pregnant animals were harvested on days 14(n=3), 15(n=1), 16(n=2), 17(n=1) or 20(n=2). Endometrial scrapings were collected in attempts to harvest luminal epithelial cells primarily and tissue samples were collected to harvest samples containing all cellular endometrial components. Samples were analyzed by western blot analysis and qRT-PCR to detect protein and mRNA expression of both PLA2s Group IV and VI. Western blot results revealed that protein expression of Group IVA was greatest on day ten of the estrous cycle but was not significantly different form days 5 and 15, possibly due to animal variation. Group IVA was significantly elevated on day 14 of pregnancy (P2 expression is not the sole regulator of prostaglandin production, but it does play an integral role that is tissue and cell type specific in both the estrous cycle and early pregnancy.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Development of Novel Vaccines for Campylobacter Control in Poultry</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Jones, Lindsay Ann</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Campylobacter is the leading bacterial cause of human enteritis in developed countries. Human campylobacteriosis is commonly associated with consumption of undercooked, contaminated chicken, a natural host of Campylobacter. Thus, control of Campylobacter colonization in poultry at the farm level would reduce the risk of human exposure to this pathogen. Vaccination is an attractive intervention measure to mitigate Campylobacter in poultry. Our recent studies have demonstrated that the outer membrane proteins CmeC (an essential component of CmeABC multidrug efflux pump) and CfrA (ferric enterobactin receptor) are feasible candidates for immune intervention against Campylobacter. By targeting these two promising vaccine candidates, three novel vaccines were developed for different vaccination strategies in this study. To construct DNA vaccines for in ovo and intranasal immunization, cfrA and cmeC genes were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCAGGS; sequencing of the recombinant vectors confirmed the success of cloning. Transfection was also performed to determine the production of CfrA or CmeC in NIH 3T3-L1 and HEK-293 cell lines. To develop effective subunit vaccines for intranasal or oral vaccination, purification of recombinant CfrA (rCfrA) and CmeC (rCmeC) was optimized. Substantial quantities of highly purified rCfrA and rCmeC were produced through nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni- NTA) affinity chromatography. The purified rCfrA and rCmeC were further encapsulated into chitosan microsphere. Various encapsulation conditions were explored. To construct the attenuated Salmonella-vectored vaccine, cfrA and cmeC genes were cloned into vector pYA3493 and transferred into S. enterica serovar Typhimurium χ8914 [strain 8914], the USDA licensed live attenuated vaccine strain. The oral live Salmonella vaccines producing CfrA or CmeC (full length or truncated) were successfully constructed; expression of the target protein was confirmed by immunoblotting using specific antiserum. The efficacies of two live vaccines that produce CfrA or CmeC were evaluated using broiler chickens. Specific systemic and intestinal mucosal response was not significantly stimulated upon oral vaccination of chickens with the attenuated Salmonella derivatives. Together, three novel Campylobacter vaccines were developed in this study, which provides us a solid foundation to further develop and evaluate different vaccination regimens for effective mitigation of Campylobacter in poultry in the future.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Manipulating Lipolysis to Reduce Fatness and Improve Carcass Composition in Commercial Broilers</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ray, Rodney Barnett</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Betaine has been studied as an osmolyte and methyl group donor for many species. Recent studies have found that betaine is able to increase muscle mass and reduce adiposity in meat type broilers birds. In experiment one, eight-hundred Cobb 500 broiler chicks were supplemented with betaine at 0.6 g/kg and 1.2g/kg. Birds had access to feed and water for ad libitum consumption for forty-two, forty-four, and forty-nine days. Birds and feed were weighed weekly. Carcass parameters (dress weight, breast percentage, and leg percentage) were taken at slaughter on days forty- two and forty-nine. Blood was taken at day forty-four to assess nonesterified fatty acids, triglycerides and glucose. Betaine did not have an effect on carcass performance, triglycerides or glucose. Betaine did however have a significant effect on NEFA concentration (p&lt;0.05) indicating a betaine induced change in lipolysis.
In experiment two, ten one day old broilers were used to establish a protocol for lipolysis in broiler adipose explants. Adipose depots were harvested, cultured and treated with a variety of known lipolytic agents and nuclear receptor agonists. Media concentrations of glycerol and NEFA were measured to assess lipolytic activity of the explants. Treatments included: glucagon, isobutyl-1-methylxanthine(IBMX), isoproterenol, betaine, TO-901317, GW-7647 and rosiglitazone. Bezafibrate, IBMX, glucagon and TO-901317 had an significant effect on media glycerol and non-esterified fatty acid concentration (p&lt;0.05) indicating an increase in lipolysis.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Bovine mammary interleukin-8 receptor expression and genetic association with Streptococcus uberis based mastitis.</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Siebert, Lydia Jean</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Mastitis is an economically distressing disease in the dairy industry. Bacterial pathogens enter the gland and encounter cell types that release immune mediators including interleukin (IL)-8. IL-8 has two membrane bound receptors: CXCR1 and CXCR2. CXCR1 and CXCR2 are expressed on neutrophils and other cell types in other species but their expression is unknown in the bovine mammary gland. To test this, mammary tissue samples from six Holstein dairy cows were subject to dual immunofluorescence with bovine specific CXCR1 and CXCR2 antibodies and cell type markers. CXCR1 was expressed on alveolar epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and leukocytes. CXCR2 expression was identified on alveolar epithelial cells and leukocytes. Within the bovine CXCR1 sequence, key amino acids 122, 207, 245, 327, and 332 have the potential to influence receptor efficiency in ligand binding and/or downstream signaling effects. Previous studies have linked some of these SNPs with mastitic phenotypes. The three SNPs (VWHRR, VWHKH, and AWQRR) were representative of 99% of the population. To test the haplotype effect, forty Holstein dairy cows were haplotyped and experimentally challenged with Streptococcus uberis. Various infection responses were monitored until 28 days post challenge. All cows with the VWHRR x VWHRR (n=5) and AWQRR x VWHRR (n=6) haplotype combinations required antibiotic treatment to clear infection whereas only 33.33% of VWHRR x VWHKH cows (n=7) required antibiotic therapy (p=0.0153). Cows with a VWHRR homozygous haplotype displayed significantly higher milk (1.05 ± [plus or minus] 0.21) and mammary (1.23 ± [plus or minus] 0.17) scores and AWQRR x VWHRR cows had significantly lower milk (0.17 ± [plus or minus] 0.18) and mammary (0.41 ± [plus or minus] 0.14) scores then cows of all other haplotype combinations (p=0.0263 and p=0.0161 respectively) indicating levels of inflammation differed among haplotype combinations. VWHRR homozygous cows also displayed significantly higher S. uberis bacteria counts (981.99 ± [plus or minus] 1947.05) then cows of any other haplotype combination (p=0.0348). Somatic cell counts (p=0.1399) and milk yield (p=0.6126) were not influenced by haplotype. Coupling this knowledge together indicates the critical role this receptor-ligand complex plays in a cow’s ability to resist mastitis.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Effects of Raw Soybeans, T-2 Mycotoxin and Their Interaction on the Performance, Immunocompetence, and Reproduction of Bobwhite Quail (&lt;em&gt;Colineus virginianus&lt;/em&gt;)</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hernandez-Bobonis, Clarivel</dc:creator>
<dc:description>These experiments were conducted to determine if there is a negative effect of raw soybeans, T-2 toxin and their interaction on performance, immunocompetence and reproduction of bobwhite quail. Birds were fed diets, containing 0, 20, 40 or 60% raw soybeans and orally dosed with 0, 9 or 12 mg T-2 toxin per kg body weight. Mortality, food consumption and body weight gain were recorded for performance analysis. Birds were bled seven days before first T-2 toxin treatment, 24 hours after each treatment and two weeks after last treatment. Total white blood cells (WBC) and percentage WBC were counted from this blood to identify any immunosupresion. One week before the dosing period lights were increased to 16 hours per day to induce puberty. Hen day and hen housed egg production was determined for 12 weeks. Eggs from the first four weeks of egg production were set for hatchability data (percent fertility, percent fertile hatchability and percent total hatchability). Live chicks from the first four hatches were weighed at 4 weeks of age to determine differences due to maternal exposure to raw soybeans and T-2 toxin. A second experiment was performed to determine the effect of T-2 toxin on testicular morphology. Fifteen male bobwhite quail were assigned to receive intermittent doses of 0, 12, or 16mg T-2 toxin per kg BW. Birds were sacrificed on day 22 and the left testis was removed and fixed for histological analysis.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Structural and Functional Organization of Macroarthropod Communities in a Mined Versus a Pristine Stream in the Cumberland Mountains of Eastern Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Schiller, Joseph R.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The effects of surface mining coal on the structural and functional organization of macroarthropod communities as a result of changes in the physical structure of small streams was investigated. Two first order streams in the Cumberland Mountains of eastern Tennessee, a pristine reference stream and a stream mined approximately 15 years earlier, were compared for particulate organic matter (POM) dynamics, structural and functional group composition, and productivity of their mecroarthropod communities. POM dynamics of the two streams were compared by measuring their input, standing stock, and processing in each stream. Macroinvertebrates were sampled with standard Surber samplers. The community structure of the two streams was compared in terms of taxonomic composition, abundance, species richness, and Shannon diversity. Functional group composition of the macroarthropod communities were compared using the functional group classification of Merritt and Cummins (1984). Productivity of the dominant taxa was calculated by the size-frequency method. The total productivity and productivity within functional feeding groups were then compared.
Input and standing stock of POM in the two streams was similar. Faster rates of POM processing in the mined stream resulted from greater macroarthropod shredder densities. Differences in POM processing, macroarthropod functional group composition, and productivity within functional groups between the two streams suggest that their macroarthropod communities are functionally different. The lower abundance, species richness, and diversity were typical of the structural differences reported for other macroarthropod communities in mined streams of this region. Overall productivity of the surface mined stream was similar to the reference stream, although it was disturbed differently between functional groups.
The results indicated that analysis of the functional group organization of mined streams reveals important differences in their ecology which could be underestimated or overlooked by conventional indices of community structure. Taxonomic surveys and diversity indices provide useful tools for monitoring and detection of environmental degradation. However, additional understanding of the causal relationships between environmental disturbance and biological change can be obtained from a functional approach which can identify its effects on specific biological processes in the stream community.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Broiler Performance and Mineral Utilization of Enzyme-Supplemented Defatted Rice Bran Diet during Heat Stress</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Puminn, Ornprapun</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Defatted rice bran is a by-product from the solvent-extraction of rice bran. It contains high amounts of phytate and non-starch polysaccharides, which are considered to be two major antinutritional factors that limit the use of rice bran in poultry diets. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate broiler performance and mineral utilization of defatted rice bran diets supplemented with commercial enzyme phytase alone or a combination of phytase and xylanase under two different environmental temperatures. In the first experiment, six replicate groups of day-old chicks were assigned to five dietary treatments comprised of a control corn-soybean meal diet with 25% corn starch and four diets containing two levels of defatted rice bran (10 and 25%) with or without phytase (500 units/kg diet) supplementation. In experiment 2, five replicate groups of chicks were assigned to dietary treatments similar to first experiment, but using both phytase (500 units/kg diet) and xylanase (1000 units/kg diet) instead of phytase alone plus an additional basal corn-soybean meal based diet. Available phosphorus in diets containing phytase was calculated to be 0.1% reduction from the requirement for broilers. On day 21, some birds were slaughtered and tibias harvested for mineral analysis. The remaining birds were transferred to either a thermoneutral temperature chamber (23.9oC) or a heat stress chamber (23.9-35oC, diurnal). Digesta retention time was determined on day 35. Birds were slaughtered at seven weeks of age, tibias harvested, and intestines examined.
In both experiments, using up to 25% defatted rice bran in diets was not detrimental to broilers. The beneficial effect of high fat level can overcome some problems associated with high phytate phosphorus and non-starch polysaccharide in defatted rice bran. As a result, birds fed 25% defatted rice bran diet had the highest body weight gain. Supplementing with enzymes improved feed conversion ratio of 3-week-old chicks fed 10% defatted rice bran diet. No significant differences were found in weight percentage of most parts of the carcass, as well as in morphology of the duodenum and the jejunum examined by villi height and crypt depth measurements. Abdominal fat was increased in birds fed 25% defatted rice bran diets. Tibia phosphorus, zinc and manganese content of chicks fed 10% defatted rice bran diet were improved by supplemental phytase alone, while tibia calcium, phosphorus, and manganese content of chicks were improved when both enzymes were added to 25% defatted rice bran diet. However, only the improvement of tibia phosphorus of 7-week-old birds was detected when phytase was added to 25% defatted rice bran diet or when both enzymes were added to 10% defatted rice bran diet. Although percent phosphorus in the excreta was decreased in both experiments in birds fed 25% defatted rice bran diets supplemented with enzyme, phosphorus retention of birds did not improve by using phytase alone. Since the price of rice bran was cheaper than other major ingredients, use of 25% defatted rice bran diet lowered feed cost per weight gain of broilers. From the growth performance and feed cost per weight gain of birds, supplemental enzyme did not alleviate the adverse effects of heat stress.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Portal-Drained Viscera, Hepatic and Lower Hindquarter Net Flux of Nitrogen and Energy Metabolites in Ruminants Fed Protein Supplements Containing Increasing Amounts of Bound Nitrogen and Structural Carbohydrates</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Housewright, Byron Clark</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Fifteen experiments were conducted on nine mature, nonlactating, nonpregnant ewes to compare distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) to soybean meal (SBM) on both an energy and a protein basis. Ewes were equipped with chronic indwelling catheters in the caudal aorta and caudal vena cava, portal, hepatic and mesenteric veins. Ewes were assigned randomly to one of three isocaloric, isonitrogenous diets. Diets were corn cob based and balanced for energy with the addition of corn starch. Protein source for these diets was either SBM, DDGS or a combination of the two, mixed so that 50% of the protein was supplied by DDGS and the remaining 50% supplied by SBM (DDGS + SBM). Animals were fed once daily and consumed a minimum of 1.1 kg/d for a minimum of 10 days prior to blood collection periods. Paraaminohippurate (PAH) was infused into a mesenteric vein and 1 h was allowed for near equilibration. Subsequently, six samples were taken simultaneously from caudal aorta, caudal vena cava, hepatic and portal veins, at 30 min intervals. Following the sixth sample the infusion line was changed to the caudal aorta. A 15 min equilibration time was followed by three samples taken at 15 min intervals, simultaneously from the caudal vena cava and a jugular vein. These samples were used to calculate blood flows across the hindquarters. Samples underwent sameday analysis for glucose, free fatty acids (FFA), PAH (for blood flow), beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) and acetoacetate (ACAC). Plasma was harvested and frozen for later analyses of VFA, ammonia nitrogen (AN), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and alpha-amino N. Portal drained viscera (PDV) values in kcal/d were similar across diets, indicating similar energy availability from each of the three diets. FFA arterial concentrations were elevated (P&lt;.01) when ewes received DDGS + SBM as a result of a 4 - 5 fold increase (P&lt;.01) in hindquarter release of FFA. No physiologically significant changes occurred with respect to either ACAC of BOHB. A decrease in the percentage of energy released into the portal blood in the form of VFA was noted in DDGS and DDGS + SBM vs. SBM. PDV release of AN was less (P&lt;.05) on DEDGS (8.7 un/h) than SBM (13.8 um/h), while DDGS + SBM was not significantly different than either treatment. Release of BUN into the portal blood was higher (P&lt;.1) on DDGS than SBM, however, liver uptake and calculated TSP release of BUN was similar across diets. Gut release of alpha-amino N was similar across treatments (SBM 8.4 um/h, DDGS 8.4 um/h, DDGS + SBM 13.2 um/h). Based on data reported in this study it seems that DDGS is at least equal to S&quot;BM as a protein supplement, in terms of energy and nitrogen release by the gut and subsequent hepatic and peripheral tissue metabolism.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Lotic dragonfly (&lt;em&gt;Anisoptera: Odonata&lt;/em&gt;) nymphs of the Southeastern United States: identification, distribution and historical biogeography</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Louton, Jerry A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>An identification guide to the southeastern United States lotic dragonfly nymphs is constructed. Descriptions, figures, keys, verification tables, and distribution maps are provided to facilitate identification of families, genera, and species. Information developed in the study of nymphs is utilized to evaluate arrangements of taxa that have been traditionally based solely on adult characters. Traditional arrangements are supported except (1) subgenera of the genus Gomphus s.1. are highly distinctive in the nymphal stage and should be elevated to generic rank and (2) two species, Gomphurus consanguis and G. rogersi are improperly placed and as a group deserve generic rank.
A study of ranges of North American species led to an analysis of the historical biogeography of the genera. An analysis of the worldwide distribution of genera of the North American fauna led to the following conclusions: (1) the Nearctic fauna is composed of relicts of a once continuous Holarctic Tertiary fauna, a few Jurassic relicts, and minor lineages derived from the Neotropical realm, (2) species of the modern fauna are considered to have differentiated by late Tertiary or early Pleistocene times and (3)  certain other nominal species or yet unrecognized taxa are considered of subspecific rank and of late Pleistocene age.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Effect of Bedding Surface and Muscid Fly Populations on the Welfare of Pre weaned Holstein and Jersey Calves</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kurman, Christa Anne</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The first objective of this study was to determine the effect of bedding on the welfare of Holstein and Jersey calves housed using individual hutches bedded with gravel, rubber mats, or sand. A second objective was to determine the effects of stable and house fly populations on calf welfare. Bedding quality and fly management are aspects of improving animal welfare on dairy farms. It was hypothesized that sand or mat would increase lying time and decrease lying bouts, but not affect BW gain or feed intake in calves indicating that these bedding surfaces increased calf welfare. It was hypothesized that as stable and house fly populations increased calf lying time and BW gain would decrease and plasma cortisol concentrations would increase. Twenty-three Holstein calves and 38 Jersey calves were assigned to 1 of 3 bedding treatments (gravel, rubber mat, or sand). Lying time and lying bouts were assessed with dataloggers. Biological function was determined by weight gain and grain intake. Plasma cortisol levels were determined using a commercial RIA kit. Data on the effect of bedding were analyzed using a mixed model in SAS with repeated measures. There was an effect of breed for all response variables so the two breeds were analyzed separately. Data indicated that there were no differences in overall calf welfare among bedding treatments. For the final analysis of the effect of stable and house fly populations on calf welfare 11 Holstein and 19 Jersey calves born between from September 2012 to October 2012 were utilized. Fly populations were monitored using alsynite traps. Data on the effect of stable and house flies on lying time, BW gain, and plasma cortisol levels were analyzed using linear regression in SAS. Data indicate that as stable and house fly populations increased welfare of calves decreased.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Impact of Matrix Metallopeptidase-9 Supplementation During In Vitro Maturation of Bovine Oocytes</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Goodwin, Megan Rene</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Heat-induced decreases in bovine blastocyst development have been related to reductions in latent matrix metallopeptidase-9 (proMMP9) production from maturing cumulus-oocyte complexes. Elevated intrafollicular proMMP9 levels at the time of oocyte retrieval have been positively related to pregnancy following human IVF. Thus, we hypothesized that heat-induced reductions in proMMP9 levels during oocyte maturation may be responsible for decreased blastocyst development. As a first step towards testing this hypothesis, bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes were matured at 38.5°C for 24 h with 0 or 300 ng/mL recombinant human proMMP9 (rhMMP9) added at 0 h of in vitro maturation (hIVM). No differences were found in ability of oocytes to cleave or form blastocyst-stage embryos after IVF. In a second study, cumulus-oocyte complexes were matured at 38.5 or 41.0°C (first 12 h only, then transferred to 38.5°C). At 12 hIVM, 0 or 300 ng/mL of rhMMP9 was added. Heat stress exposure decreased 24 hIVM proMMP9 levels in 0 (P = 0.006) but not 300 ng/mL groups and elevated progesterone levels most when 300 ng/mL rhMMP9 was added (P = 0.0002). Heat stress exposure did not affect ability of oocytes to cleave but reduced blastocyst development (P = 0.006). Independent of maturation temperature, addition of rhMMP9 decreased cleavage (P = 0.02) and blastocyst development (P = 0.08). In a third study, 0, 30 or 300 ng/mL rhMMP9 was added at 18 hIVM to cumulus-oocyte complexes matured at 38.5 or 41.0°C (first 12 h only, then transferred to 38.5°C). Heat stress exposure decreased 24 hIVM proMMP9 levels in 0 (P = 0.007) and 30 (P = 0.04) but not 300 ng/mL groups and increased progesterone levels in 0 and 300 but not 30 ng/mL rhMMP9 groups (P = 0.039). Heat stress exposure decreased cleavage (P &lt; 0.0001) and blastocyst development (P &lt; 0.0001). Independent of maturation temperature, addition of rhMMP9 did not alter cleavage but decreased blastocyst development (P = 0.02). In summary, addition of rhMMP9 at evaluated doses and times during IVM did not restore development of heat-stressed oocytes. Addition of 30 or 300 ng/mL rhMMP9 after 12 hIVM, regardless of maturation temperature, was detrimental to development.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Impact of supplementing rumen-protected arginine on blood flow parameters and luteinizing hormone concentration in cyclic beef cows consuming endophyte-infected tall fescue seed</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Edwards, Melissa Ann</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Livestock grazing endophyte-infected tall fescue can have decreased performance due to vasoconstriction and reduced reproductive performance. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of supplementing rumen-protected arginine to cows consuming endophyte-infected tall fescue seed on caudal blood flow and LH dynamics. Four ruminally cannulated, open beef cows (539 ± 30 kg) were used in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments utilizing a Latin Square design with 4 periods of 31 d each. Each cow was assigned to individual pens and fed orchardgrass hay (10.3% CP and 85% NDF; OM basis) during a 10-d adaptation period, followed by a 21-d collection period in which each cow was assigned one of 4 treatments: (1) rumen-protected ARG (180 mg/kg of BW) and 1.0 kg/d of endophyte-infected fescue seed (AE+); (2) rumen-protected ARG (180 mg/kg of BW) and 1.0 kg/d of non-infected fescue seed (AE-); (3) 1.0 kg/d of endophyte-infected fescue seed (E+) alone; or (4) 1.0 kg/d of non-infected fescue seed (E-) alone. In each period, doppler ultrasound measurements for blood flow parameters were quantified on d 1, 5, 10, 15, and 19. On d 20 of each period, blood samples were collected every 10 min for 6 h and then once every hour for 12 h. Caudal blood flow exhibited an interaction (P = 0.05) of ARG × fescue seed type, resulting from an increase in blood flow in cows fed rumen-protected ARG. In addition, mean velocity was greater (P = 0.01) with the inclusion of rumen-protected ARG in the diet. Caudal artery area (P = 0.03) and diameter (P = 0.01) were decreased in cows consuming E+ compared to E- with no effect (P ≥ 0.38) by ARG supplementation. Mean serum LH concentration exhibited (P = 0.02) an ARG × fescue seed type interaction. Cows consuming E+ had decreased LH concentrations compared to all other treatments. However, cows consuming AE+ had similar LH concentrations compared to cows consuming AE- or E-. Thus, supplementing rumen-protected ARG to cows grazing endophyte-infected fescue seed has the potential to increase reproductive performance and peripheral blood flow.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Stearns, Larry M.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Some time ago as a result of study in ornithology and perusal of literature in the University of Tennessee libraries, I became interested in observing behavior of birds closely, i.e., particularly captive birds. In the literature I found no mention of the use of feeding behavior as a focal point for observations concerning species interaction and dominance relationships. Therefore, after consultation with Professor Howell, approval of plans, and receipt of funds from the University of Tennessee, I built and aviary. We decided to build the aviary of the roof of the east wing of Hesler Biology Building, University of Tennessee campus because of the secluded nature of the site. It was an outdoor site easily and conveniently reached by myself and Professor Howell and was not subject to visits by unauthorized personnel.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A New Hypothesis Conerning the Sequence and Nature of Meiotic Events in the Female of Drosophila Melanogaster</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Grell, Rhonda F.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Three of the basic phenomena comprising the meiotic process are synapsis, crossingover, and disjunction.  It is generally conceded that some form of pairing must precede crossingover; that the crossingover process occurs prior to disjunction; and that disjunction implies a previous association of elements.  Construction of a model describing the causal relations among the three events might be expected to be fairly simple, since the possibilities are limited.  Yet, no model has been proposed that is consistent with all the genetic data.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Studies of Protein-bound Sulfhydryl and Disulfide Groups in the Mitotic Apparatus of the Sea Urchin, Arbacia punctulata</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kawamura, Naoko</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Problems in the present study
From the studies of Sakai and Dan (1959), it became apparent that the changes in soluble SH groups during the first division of sea urchin eggs, as reported by Rapkine (1931), represent the changes in protein SH groups dissolved in 25% TCA. It is also certain from the cytochemical study of the mitotic apparatus (Kawamura and Dan, 1958) that there are abundant SH groups in the protein of spindle and astral fibers. However, there is no evidence to show whether the total amount of protein-bound SH groups (present in both the 25% TCA-soluble and insoluble protein) changes during the course of formation of the mitotic apparatus, whether the amount of protein-bound S-S groups changes, and whether there exist s-s groups in the mitotic apparatus as stated by Mazia (1954). If there is an increase in the amount of s-s groups in fibers of the mitotic apparatus, where do they originate? In order to answer the above questions and to uncover the secret of the mechanism of formation of mitotic apparatus, it is necessary to measure protein-bound SH groups as well as s-s groups. It is also essential to correlate cytochemical observations with the data derived from the measurements of such groups.
In the present study, changes in protein-bound SH and s-s groups in sea urchin eggs during the first division cycle were followed cytochemically and quantitatively. Special attention is given to the possible role of these groups in the structure and origin of the mitotic apparatus of sea urchin eggs.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Comparative Bioavailability of Sediment-Sorbed Hexachlorobiphenyl</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Swindoll, C. Michael</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The bioavailability of sediment-sorbed hexachlorobiphenyl (HCB) to bacteria, midge larvae (Chironomus tentans), and mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) was examined in order to elucidate the influence of abiotic and biotic factors on the bioaccumulation process. Factors examined included sediment type, sediment organic matter, HCB concentration, temperature, and biological viability. Additional experiments were conducted to evaluate the relative role of sediment and dietary HCB sources to the accumulation of HCB in mosquitofish.
In general, the bioavailability of sediment-sorbed HCB was inversely related to the surface area and the organic content of the sediment. The organic content of the sediment was deemed important due to its large surface area and its hydrophobic intermatrix, which accounts for the affinity of organic matter for hydrophobic organic compounds. The bioaccumulation of HCB was proportional to the sediment HCB concentration. Changes in temperature did not alter the steady-state HCB concentrations in midge. HCB accumulation was similar in live and dead bacteria; however, live midge had greater HCB accumulation than dead midge. Mosquitofish HCB accumulation from dietary and sediment sources was additive and approximately equal.
This investigation indicates that the physical process of equilibrium partitioning is responsible for the bioaccumulation of sediment-sorbed HCB. However, the process of equilibrium partitioning can be facilitated by physiological activity.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Head Organs of &lt;em&gt;Cleidodiscus mirabilis&lt;/em&gt; (TREMATODA MONOGENEA)</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Brown, Theodore Gates</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Introduction: Little or no detailed description has been heretofore attempted of Cleidodiscus, the work to date having been confined to taxonomy and general morphology (Mueller, 1934 and 1937; Mizelle, 1938; Mizelle and Cronin, 1943).
The head organs and cephalic glands were chosen for this study because of their conspicuous nature in the living animal and, at the same time, their confinement to a relatively small anatomical area. Since no minute description of these structures is known, an attempt was made to discover their exact histologic nature. The methods to be used were to include well known techniques of fixation, sectioning, and staining, but, in addition, an attempt was made to try to evaluate the usefulness of the phase-contrast microscope as a supplementary tool especially for examination of living material.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Effects of Alloxan on the Histology of the Pancreas, Thyroid and Adrenal Glands of the White Rat</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Cagle, Julien L.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Introduction: Prior to 1943, two methods of producing experimental diabetes mellitus in laboratory animals were known, pancreatectomy and the injection of anterior pituitary extract. In that year, the discovery of a third method, the destruction of the pancreatic islands of Langerhans by the intravenous injection of alloxan, was announced by Dunn, Sheehan and McLetchie. These workers were conducting an investigation into the pathogenesis of the renal lesion of the crush syndrome and the similar condition which occurs in mis-matched blood transfusions. Substances were being tried which influence the lower renal tubules, such as uric acid and related compounds. Among the most promising was alloxan, an oxidation product of uric acid. However, with the dosages required to obtain the renal lesions, many of the rabbits died during the first day or so with symptoms which could not be related to kidney damage. In the examination of these early mortalities, they discovered the characteristic lesion of the islets, and further investigation gave them rabbits exhibiting the typical tri-phasic blood sugar picture, with permanent diabetes resulting.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effects of Female Sex Hormones and Dietary Magnesium Levels in Sheep</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Marbury, Kenny S.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The major objectives of this study were to evaluate (a) the effects of diet on magnesium, calcium and potassium metabolism in yearling wethers and (b) the effects of progesterone, estradiol and diethylstilbestrol (DES) on the metabolism of the minerals.
A two by two factorial design was selected whereby twelve yearling crossbred wether lambs were divided into four groups of three. One group was fed a basal diet plus magnesium along with hormones, one group was fed a basal diet plus magnesium without hormones, one group was fed a magnesium-deficient diet along with hormones, and one group was fed a magnesium-deficient diet without hormones.
During trial one, two of the groups were injected intramuscularly with progesterone every twelve hours for four consecutive days. Then, forty-eight hours after the last injection of progesterone, 100 μg of estradiol was injected intramuscularly in two separate injections (50 μg per injection) six hours apart. This was intended to simulate the hormonal milieu of an ewe coming into estrus. At the time of the initial injection of estradiol, 61.3 μc of magnesium-28 and 701 μc of calcium-45 were administered orally via a lubricated balling gun to each of the wethers. Whereas during trial two, four mg DES was administered orally for twenty-one days while consuming either the basal diet plus magnesium or a magnesium-deficient diet.
The major finding of this research was that when animals were fed a magnesium-deficient diet along with a high-potassium level in the diet there was a greater retention of potassium than in animals fed a basal diet plus magnesium and a high level of potassium.
The progesterone and estradiol stimulated appetite, increased calcium and magnesium intake, increased calcium and magnesium excretion in the urine and feces, increased retention of potassium, increased plasma potassium, decreased plasma calcium, increased the calcium-45 in urine and increased the calcium-45 in the plasma at peak levels (p &lt; 0.05). The interaction of these two hormones with diet showed that the animals that were fed the basal diet plus magnesium and injected with hormones excreted more magnesium-28 for the twenty-four and forty-eight hour test period, and for the complete test period.
The animals fed DES consumed less feed, consumed less calcium and magnesium, excreted less calcium and magnesium in the feces, excreted more magnesium in the urine, and excreted less calcium in the urine and had a greater concentration of magnesium in the plasma. The interaction of DES X diet showed that the animals that were fed DES and maintained on a magnesium-deficient diet had the least amount of plasma potassium of any group.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Some Aspects of Amino Acid Regulation in the Tobacco Hornworm, &lt;em&gt;Manduca sexta&lt;/em&gt;</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Henry, J. Michael</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The nature and roles of the high free amino acid levels found in the haemolymph of insects is poorly understood. In order to elicit aspects of the regulation and metabolism of haemolymph free amino acids, we have measured the concentrations, half-lives, turnover rates and rate of incorporation into haemolymph proteins for eight amino acids in the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta immediately prior to and throughout the larval-pupal transformation. Throughout this period the concentrations of alanine, arginine, glutamate, histidine, leucine, lysine, proline and valine each exhibited stage specific variations seemingly independent of blood volumes and levels of other amino acids. Half-lives for these amino acids also exhibited reproducible state specific variations indicating independent regulation. Half-lives demonstrated a wide range of utilization (2-170 hours) and do not change in parallel fashion for the amino acids investigated. Conclusions drawn from this study are that a) amino acids are regulated and b) although some amino acids such as histidine appear to be stored in haemolymph, most are dynamically maintained and must be major determinants of insect homeostasis.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Antibiotic Treatment at a Prebreeding Estrus on Subsequent Reproductive Efficiency</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lamar, Kenneth C.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a douche with an antibiotic formula to improve reproductive efficiency in dairy cows.
A total of 102 cows was utilized in the experiment. The 81 Holstein cows were divided into four groups. These groups were untreated cows which had normal post-calving recuperation (N-C), treated cows with had normal post-calving recuperation (N-T), untreated cows which had experienced post-calving complications (M-C), and treated cows which had experienced post-calving complications (M-T). The 20 Jersey cows were divided into treated and untreated groups (N-T and N-C). The treatment consisted of a nitrofurozone-neomycin mixture in a 7 to 1 ratio.
The effectiveness of the treatment was evaluated by comparing the interval to first heat, number of prebreeding heats, interval to first service, interval to conception, and conception rates resulting from one and two services.
The analysis indicates that there was no difference (P &gt; .05) in days to first heat, number of prebreeding heats, or days to first service.
In the Holstein data, the M-T group had the highest conception rate. There was a difference (P &lt; .05) in conception rates between the groups. There was no difference (P &gt; .05) between conception rates of the N-C and N-T groups. However, the trend was for the N-T group to have higher conception rates.
In the Jersey data, there were no differences in conception rates between the two groups on first service or first and second service.
There was no difference (P &gt; .05) between the groups in number of days to conception for the animal conceiving in two or less services in the Holstein data. However, it is the author's opinion that there would be a difference if the experiment had been continued. This is based on the fact that the majority of cows in group M-C were still open at the conclusion of the experiment. There were no differences (P &gt; .05) between the groups in days to conception in the Jersey cows.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Use of Sodium Bicarbonate in Complete Rations for Lactating Cows</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bogart, Brian C.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Sixty-two Holstein cows were assigned to respective treatments of a randomized complete block design three days postpartum. Complete rations, formulated to meet NRC requirement, were fed during the first 112 days of lactation. Diets contained, on an as-fed basis, 75% corn silage and 25% pelleted concentrate (CS:PC) or (CS:PC) + .5% feed grade sodium bicarbonate added as a percent of the total ration (CS:PC+). In addition, each cow received 5 lb of alfalfa-grass hay daily (as fed).
Data collected weekly included milk yield (1b/d), milk fat (percent), 4% fat corrected milk (1b/d), ration dry matter intake (percent of body weight), and total dry matter intake (percent of body weight). Least-square means values of these parameters were 62.76, 3.30, 56.26. 2.09, 2.44, and 60.91, 3.42, 55.66, 2.19, 2.55 for CS:PC and CS:PC+, respectively. Significant treatment differences were not observed between diets (P &gt; .05). Rumen fluid, blood, and additional milk samples were collected at monthly intervals from 27 cows randomly chosen from the total. Acetate-to-proportionate ratio and rumen pH values were 2.85, 6.45, and 2.66, 6.31 for CS:PC and CS:PC+, respectively. Blood serum Ca, P, Mg and Na values (mg/100 ml) were 9.44, 5.25, 2.22, 403.13, and 10.09, 5.40, 2.14 405.37 for CS:PC and CS:PC+, respectively. Least-square mean values for milk protein (percent), total solids (percent), and solids-not-fat (percent) were 3.95, 12.13, 8.87, and 3.98, 11.93, 8.53 for CS:PC and CS:PC+, respectively. No significant differences could be attributed to diets on data collection monthly (P &gt; .05).
Results of this study indicate that incorporation of .5% sodium bicarbonate to complete rations was neither efficacious nor detrimental to dairy cows in early lactation.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effects of Radioactive Phosphorus In Vitro on Oxygen Consumption of Semen</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Folmar, Glenn D.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Under the conditions of this study, the levels of radiation used did not significantly alter the oxygen consumption of boar and bull sperm.
The average oxygen consumption of ninety replicates of non-treated boar semen representing thirteen different ejaculates from two boars was 201.5 micro liters of oxygen per billion sperm during the first hour of measurement, with a range of 84.6 to 295.8.  The average oxygen consumption of seventy-nine replicates of treated boar semen representing twelve different ejaculates from the same two boars was 187.4 microliters of oxygen per billion sperm during the first hour of measurement, with a range of 70.2 to 264.6.
The average oxygen consumption of seventeen replicates of boar seminal fluid representing six different ejaculates was 0.04 microliters of oxygen per milliliter of seminal fluid during the first hour of measurement.  Seminal fluid from only three of the ejaculates consumed oxygen, while the seminal fluid from the other three ejaculates evolved an unknown gas or gases, other than carbon dioxide, instead of consuming oxygen.
The average oxygen consumption of twelve replicates of non-treated bull semen representing five different semen samples from four bulls was 79.4 microliters of oxygen per billion sperm during the first hour of measurement, with a range of 29.4 to 172.1.  The average oxygen consumption of six replicates of treated bull semen representing the same three semen samples from the same three bulls was 86.1 microliters of oxygen per billion sperm during the first hour of measurement, with a range of 28.2 to 157.9.
Bull seminal fluid from only one out of five semen samples consumed oxygen, while eleven replicates representing four semen samples evolved an average of 15.4 microliters of an unknown gas or gases, other than carbon dioxide, per milliliter of seminal fluid during the first hour of measurement.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Availability of Phosphorus in Two Defluorinated Phosphates to Sheep as Determined by a Radioisotope Technique</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Pippin, Carlen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Phosphorus deficiency has limited livestock production since the beginning of recorded history . This is understandable in view of the essentiality of phosphorus to various life processes and of the problems of providing adequate amounts of available phosphorus in rations for livestock.
One of the best known functions of phosphorus is its importance in building bones and teeth.  Also, it has an equally important function in every living cell of the body.  It is essential for the utilization and metabolism of the other nutrients such as proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.  Muscles cannot grow and divide, and cells cannot move except under the influence of phosphorous.  This element is, therefore, very closely associated with the basic nature of living matter.
In the early days of nutrition research investigators worked long and hard in proving that animals could utilize the inorganic form of many elements, such as phosphorous, as well as their organically bound forms.  Later it was rather widely assumed that all inorganic chemical forms of an element such as phosphorous were of equal feeding value.  More recent studies have shown that this is not the case, and that a given weight of an element from one source may be less effective than the same amount from another source.
Increased demands for feed phosphorus and shortages of bone meal have been greatly increased the need for other sources of phosphorus, and several different sources are now available.
Among the most common of these sources are defluorinated domestic rock phosphates, dicalcium phosphate, Curacao Island phosphate, and a limited amount of bone meal and phosphoric acid.
The biological availability of phosphorus in these supplements to ruminants has not been widely studied.  This is due to the expense and length of time required for conventional metabolism studies.  During the past few years an in vitro technique, involving washed rumen microorganisms, has been proposed as quick and less expensive method of assaying phosphorus supplements.  The validity with which results from this technique can be applied directly to the animal has not been determined.
With the advent of the radioisotope dilution technique, the true digestibility of the phosphorus in a supplement can now be determined.  The specific objective of the experiments reported in this thesis was to determine the true digestibility of the phosphorus in two defluorinated phosphate supplements using the isotope dilution technique.  The apparent availability of the phosphorus in both supplements was determined with washed rumen microorganisms prior to the initiation of the radioisotope study.  This it was possible to compare the results from both techniques.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effects of Various Fluorine Compounds on the Albino Rat</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Pevahouse, Robert Floyd</dc:creator>
<dc:description>At the beginning of the 19th century, an Italian chemist demonstrated the presence of fluorine in the teeth of both man and animals.  This discovery created considerable interest at that time and can probably be considered the initial step in stimulating research on the problem.
In the light of our present day knowledge, there is evidence that the ingestion of small amounts of fluorine may be distinctly beneficial to livestock.  However, the primary problem in animal nutrition is concerned with definitely harming effects resulting from an excessive intake.
It was only a few years ago that farmers were using raw rock phosphate as a mineral supplement in rations for livestock.  Although raw rock phosphate might supply the desired mineral ingredients at a lower cost than they might be obtained from other sources, it was learned that rock phosphate produced abnormal calcification of the teeth and possibly other changes which greatly limited its usage.  These changes were the same as could be produced experimentally by using a chemically pure fluorine salt.
Observations in Europe, and in recent years in this country, show that cattle grazing near industrial plants which give off fluorine in the smoke, such as aluminum or superphosphate plants, show excessive wear on the teeth, decrease in the rate of growth, and in some cases cause premature death.
Since Tennessee is one of the largest phosphate producing states, and since industrial plants have started a rather rapid program of expansion, there is a need for more information on the problem of chronic fluorosis.
The experiments reported in this thesis were designed primarily to study the relative toxicity of various fluorine compounds in the albino rat.  Experiments have been conducted to study the concentration of sodium fluoride and length of time of feeding necessary to produce fluorsis; to biologically test the fluorine concentration of samples of hay obtained near industral plants known to give off fluorine substances; and to investigate substances in the ration which might offer promise of alleviating the toxic effects of fluorine in the albino rat.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Factors Affecting the Performance of Broilers</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Nair, G. R.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The efficiency of broiler production has increased greatly in recent years and can be attributed to advancements in the areas of breeding, management, nutrition, and disease control.  No single factor in any one of these areas can be said to account for the major share of this increased efficiency but rather it is the combination of a large number of factors such as breeding techniques, and breed improvement, of improved management practices, and of advances in nutrition and disease control.
The optimum combination of conditions or factors for broiler production is seldom, if ever, realized.  Information which might have been considered adequate at the time it was obtained may soon become out-dated.  To continue to increase the efficiency of broiler production, frequent re-evaluation of management factors must be made and new practices developed.  It was with these thoughts in mind that the series of experiments herein reported were designed and conducted.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effects of Radioactive Phosphorus In Vitro on Oxygen Consumption of Semen</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Folmar, Glenn D.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The increasing use of radioactive isotopes and radiation in industry, chemistry, biochemistry, biophysics, biology and medicine has stimulated interest in the possible effects of radiation on the reproductive functions of both the male and female. It has been demonstrated that whole-body X-irradiation of the male increases the numbers of abnormal sperm (Boche, 1946) and that either X-irradiation of the scrotal region or whole-body X-irradiation increases the pre-natal mortality rate of the off-spring (Strandskov, 1932; Henson, 1942; and Murphree et al., 1952). Likewise, it has been shown that X-irradiation of sperm in vitro increases the pre-natal mortality rate, although no gross morphological changes were observed in sperm even at levels of radiation which completely inhibited the fertilizing capacity (Kesin, 1944 and Amoroso and Parkes, 1947).
It would appear, therefore, that the reduction in the functional capacity of sperm may occur before gross alterations in morphology are observed. It is possible that these results may be due to disturbances in cellular function. It has long been recognized that the more common methods of evaluating semen, such as motility, percentage alive, survival in storage, and morphology of sperm do not afford a completely satisfactory method of predicting potential fertility of normal sperm. In view of the fact that no gross changes in morphology or motility due to radiation damage have been observed (Kesin, 1944 and Amoroso and Parkes, 1947) it is apparent that a more sensitive test of radiation damage to sperm is needed. This study was initiated as an effort to find such a test.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Progesterone Levels in Cows Suspected of Embryonic Mortality</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Dowlen, Henry Hamilton</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The competitive protein binding assay without chromatography was used to quantitate progesterone in the peripheral plasma of cows. The objective of this experiment was to estimate progesterone concentrations in cows suspected of experiencing embryonic mortality. Samples from 19 cows were assayed. The cows were divided into the following groups according to their estrous cycle length:  (1) 20-22 days,  (2) 26-32 days,  (3) 40-69 days, and  (4) pregnant.
Jugular vein blood samples were taken beginning 12 days after insemination. The blood sampling schedule was as follows:  12,  15,  17,  19,  21,  23,  26,  29,  32,  35,  38,  41,  44,  47,  58,  61,  and 64 days post-breeding. Plasma was separated and stored at -200C until assayed. The progesterone determinations were performed on 0.5 ml aliquots of plasma.
To monitor the effectiveness of each assay, steer plasma fortified with 3 ng of progesterone were assayed for progesterone. The progesterone content of steer plasma could not be distinguished from zero and the fortified steer plasma averaged 2.75±0.09 ng per ml. Tritiated progesterone was used to estimate the recovery percentage from cow plasma. the average recovery rate for all assays was 95.6±0.6 percent.
Analysis of variance on all groups through Day 21 indicated that Group 1 was different (P&lt;0.05) from Groups 2, 3, and 4. A significant  (P&lt;0.10) day difference was found in Group 1 and no group-day interactions  (P&gt;0.05) were found in all groups. Group 2 had greater  (P&lt;0.05) progesterone concentrations than Group 1 indicating that the cows in the delayed estrus group (Group 2) may have been pregnant but experienced embryonic death shortly after implantation. This group was not different  (P&gt;0.05) from Group 4 (pregnant) at 21 days.
Comparison of Groups 3 and 4 through 47 days indicated that the progesterone level of Group 3 was significantly  (P&lt;0.01) less than the level of Group 4. From this analysis it was postulated that the cows in Group 3 may have had less progesterone than required for maintenance of pregnancy.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effects of Weaning Transition and Ionophore on Metabolic Profile and Portal and Hepatic Nutrient Flux During Pre- and Post-Weaning Growth in Dairy Calves</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Klotz, James Levi</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Dairy calf weaning is associated with increases in ketone levels that exceed measured rates of utilization in adults and present a potential energy loss that may be mitigated by ionophores.  Therefore, effects of weaning and ionophore supplementation on nutrient metabolism and growth in dairy calves pre- and post-weaning were examined in two experiments.  The first experiment consisted of 24 Jersey bulls calves blocked in groups of two according to birth date and weight and randomly assigned to receive either a commercial pelleted starter (CON), or the same diet containing lasalocid (TRT; 83 mg/kg DM) to examine effects of weaning transition on weight (BW), gain (ADG), and blood concentrations of glucose, acetoacetate (ACAC), B-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), volatile fatty acids (VFA), lactate, pyruvate, insulin, and glucagon over 16 wk.  The second experiment assessed the effects of weaning and lasalocid supplemented starter (listed above) on BW, ADG, net portal-drained viscera, hepatic, and total splanchnic fluxes of the same metabolites listed above for Experiment 1, but were measured on d 35, 56, 84, and 112 in nineteen Jersey bull calves that were equipped with catheters in portal, hepatic, and mesenteric veins and artery at wk 3-4.  In Experiments 1 and 2 all calves were fed milk replacer from d 3-34.  On d 35, calves began receiving either CON or TRT calf starter ad libitum plus their milk replacer ration until weaning on d 49.  From d49-112 calves received only CON or TRT ad libitum.  Post-weaning intake, ADG, and feed: gain did not differ between CON and TRT in either Experiment 1 and 2.  Total VFA and ketones significantly increased and NEFA and glucose significantly decreased following introduction of solid feed in both experiments.  Both experiments demonstrated significant effects of ionophore supplementation on ACAC, BHBA, and VFA during the early post-weaning period.  In both experiments significant changes in metabolic profile of transition calves were demonstrated peri-wearning and ionophore appears to moderate alimentary output at a post-weaning period where ketone concentrations have potential to exceed whole animal capacity for utilization.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Nutritional Efficiency of Angus Cow-Calf Units</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Onks, Dennis Owen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Angus cow-calf pairs were individually fed over a five-year period.  Data from 62 mature cows and 114 calves were obtained.  Cows varied in initial weight and production potential.  Cows were fed grass silage, ad libitum, throughout gestation and lactation.  Calves were fed a complete finishing and growing ration post weaning.  Efficiency of cow-calf units was defined as the ratio of the yearly TDN intake of the cow plus the pre-and post weaning TDN intake of the calves.  Second-order polynomials were fitted through the biweekly efficiency ratios for individual calves and solved to determine the most efficient point.  This efficiency was also calculated for two constant fat thicknesses and evaluated.  The TDN efficiency for three carcass components: separable muscle, protein, and energy were also determined.
At weaning, year and initial cow weight influenced cow annual TDN intake and cow-calf unit intake.  Year, sex of calf, and initial cow weight affected weaning TDN efficiency.  Calf age and weight at weaning positively influenced weaning TDN efficiency, in the pressure of initial cow weight.
Postweaning, a 100-unit increase in initial cow weight was associated with an average 2-unit increase in TDN consumption.  Unit efficiency was positively influenced postweaning by initial cow weight, indicating that lighter cows were slightly more efficient than heavier cows.  The average ages for the slaughter calves at 8mm, 12mm, and the most efficient point was 394, 440, and 462 days.  Older and/or heavier calves at weaning were associated with improved unit efficiency.
The most efficient point of the carcass components of separable muscle, protein, and energy was 478, 429, and 505 days of age, respectively.  Corresponding 12th rib fat estimates for carcass muscle, protein, and energy at the most efficient point were 17,11, and 20mm, respectively.  The average product yield at the most efficient point was 147 kg carcass muscle, 34 kg protein, and 1146 Mcal energy.  Analysis revealed that heavier weaning weights would increase the yield of carcass muscle, protein, and energy at the most efficient point.  More efficient carcass component production was associated with older and/or heavier calves at weaning, from a given size cow.  The general conclusion from a cow-calf unit standpoint, was that calves slaughtered at 12mm fat cover seemed to be the most ideal when efficiency of production, based on liveweight and carcass weight, was considered.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Comparison of Methods of Selection to Increase Yearling Weight of Beef Cattle and Assessment of Influence of Sire Differences on Estimates of Repeatability of Cow Productivity</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Turner, Thomas Bruce</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The objectives of this study were: (1) to make a theoretical comparison of progress expected by selecting for a single trait with progress expected by selection based on an index including two traits and (2) to compare estimates of repeatability of cow productivity when the effect of sire is removed from the data and when it is not.
Data were collected over a period of seven years from 581 bull calves and 552 heifer calves from the purebred Angus herd at The University of Tennessee Plateau Experiment Station, Crossville.
Variables recorded at weaning (approximately seven and one-half months of age) were age, body length, heart girth, gain from birth to weaning, and ultrasonically measured fat thickness.  Variables recorded at the post-weaning age (approximately 13 months) were heart girth, body length, gain from birth to postweaning age, postweaning gain and ultra-sonically measured fat thickness.
Components of variance due to sire differences from a model including sex, year, age of dam, fat, age of calf, and sire within year were used to calculate estimates of heritability and genetic correlation in anticipation of construction of a selection index.
Most genetic correlation estimates exceeded unity and, although the index was a more effective selection method after arbitrary reduction of the genetic correlation estimates, little confidence can be placed in the comparison because of extreme uncertainty concerning the magnitude of the true genetic correlations existing in the population.
Components of variance due to dam differences were used to calculate an estimate of repeatability of the various traits as traits of the cow.  These dam components were taken from two models, one including sire effect and one from which sire effect was excluded.  Due to appreciable sire variation among a cow's calves, removal of sire effect resulted in increased estimates of repeatability.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Performance of Feeder Heifers Fed Corn Silage Treated with 10, 15 and 20 Pounds of Urea Per Ton</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ruhman, Kadhim Abdul</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this experiment was to determine if the amount of urea could be increased above 10 pounds per ton of corn silage without adversely affecting the acceptability of the silage or the feedlot performance of feeder heifers.
One hundred and eight feeder heifers with an average weight of 450-500 pounds were involved in a two-year experiment conducted at the University of Tennessee's Blount Farm, Knoxville. Three treatments with 10, 15 and 20 pounds per ton of urea treated corn silage were used in this two-year study.
In both trials, there were three replications (pens) per treatment with six feeder heifers per pen. At the beginning of both trials, 24 mg. of diethylstilbestrol was implanted per head.
The results showed that all three levels of urea were equally acceptable, and that feedlot performance and carcass characteristics were not significantly  (P &gt; .05) affected, either positively or negatively, by the addition of 10, 15 or 20 pounds of urea per ton of corn silage. Therefore, it was concluded that, when desirable, up to 20 pounds of urea could be added per ton of corn silage without adverse effects.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Performance and Carcass Characteristics of Feeder Heifer Calves Fed Different Amounts of Concentrates with Urea-Limestone Treated Corn Silage</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Idol, Gordon Bobby</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Two feeding trials, one in 1967-68 and the other in 1968-69, were conducted at the University of Tennessee's Blount Farm to determine the effect of feeding different amounts of concentrates with urea-limestone treated corn silage on the performance and carcass characteristics of feeder heifer calves. A total of 288 animals were involved in the study. Treatments included delaying the feeding of a 6 lb. concentrate supplement for 0 (control), 56, 84, 112, 140 and 168 days during a period of high roughage feeding. Two other treatments involved the feeding of 2 or 4 lb. of concentrate during the entire roughage phase. After the roughage phase all animals were given a full feed of concentrate until they graded high-Good to low-Choice. They were then slaughtered at local packing plants.
Daily gains were highest when the heifers were fed 4 or 6 lb. of concentrate during the entire roughage phase. Delaying the feeding of the concentrate supplement for as long as 84 days resulted in gains slightly less in magnitude but not significantly (P &gt; .05) lower than those of the two highest gaining groups of heifers. The amount of feed required per hundred pounds of gain was lowest for the heifers fed 2 or 4 lb. of concentrate. Average daily dry matter consumption decreased with increased delay of concentrate feeding. Dressing percent and percent kidney fat was highest for the heifers fed 4 or 6 lb. of concentrate. Fat thickness, marbling scores, and U.S.D.A. carcass grades were highest for heifers fed 6 lb. of concentrate during the entire roughage phase. The treatments had little or no effect on ribeye area. Final condition grades generally decreased with decreases in total amount of concentrate fed. Feed cost per hundred pounds of gain was lowest for heifers fed 6 lb. of concentrate for the entire roughage phase.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Effect of the Number of Pigs Per Pen on the Performance of Growing-Finishing Swine</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hodges, John, III</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Data collected on 140 market hogs at the Knoxville Experiment Station, Knoxville, Tennessee, were used to determine the effect of the number of pigs per pen on performance of growing-finishing swine. In Trial I pigs were fed for an average of 108 days and in Trial II pigs were fed for an average of 91 days. In both trials pigs were fed in groups of 4, 6, 8, or 10 pigs per pen with space allowances of 23.8 square feet, 15.8 square feet, 11.9 square feet, or 9.5 square feet per pig, respectively.
Average daily gains in Trial I were 1.48, 1.52, 1.46, and 1.48 pounds per head per day for Treatments I, II, III, and IV, respectively. No significant difference between treatments (variation in floor space) was noted with respect to any traits measured (Trial I). However, significant (P &lt; 0.05) differences were observed between barrows and gilts.
In Trial II, average daily gains were 1.71, 1.63, 1.63, and 1.62 pounds per head per day for Treatments I, II, III, and IV, respectively. Performance of the pigs by treatment in Trial II was not significantly different as were the results of Trial I. There was a significant  (P &lt; 0.05) difference in the performance of the pigs by sex and by weight groups; however, the overall results of Trial II were similar to that nof Trial I.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>PERFORMANCE OF BEEF CATTLE GRAZING NATIVE WARM-SEASON GRASSES IN AN INTEGRATED FORAGE/BIOFUELS SYSTEM IN THE MID-SOUTH</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Backus, William Matthew</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Early season (ES) and full season (FS) grazing strategies were used to evaluate performance of stocker steers grazing native warm-season grasses (NWSG) in 2010, 2011 and 2012 in two experiments. Experiment one was conducted at the Research and Education Center (REC) at Ames Plantation near Grand Junction and experiment two was conducted at Highland Rim REC near Springfield in which Angus and Angus cross steers (268±25kg) were used in completely randomized design with three forage treatments: 1) switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.); 2) a combination of big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman) and indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans); and 3) eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides). Stands of switchgrass (SG), big bluestem and indiangrass (BB/IG) and eastern gamagrass (EG) were 3 yr old (28%) or 4 yr old. Before and after grazing NWSG pastures all steers were fed a high fiber filler diet for 4 d with individual BW taken in the early AM each day and the average BW for the last 2 d was used for initial and final BW for the grazing period. Four steers (testers) were allotted to 1.2-ha paddocks with three replications per treatment. Additional steers were used in a put-and-take manner to keep forage in a vegetative state. Steers had free choice access to pasture, water, mineral, and shade. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS. Experiment one least square means for ADG of ES steers grazing BB/IG and SG differed from EG (P &lt; 0.05) with ADG of 1.23, 1.14 and 0.84 kg/d respectively. Least square means for ADG of FS steers grazing BB/IG differed from SG and EG (P &lt; 0.05) with ADG of 0.82, 0.56 and 0.48 kg/d respectively. Experiment two least square means for ADG of ES steers grazing BB/IG differed from SG (P &lt; 0.05) with ADG of 1.09 and 0.88 kg/d respectively. Least square means for ADG of FS steers grazing BB/IG differed from SG (P &lt; 0.05) with ADG of 0.96 and 0.79 kg/d respectively. The results of these two grazing experiments demonstrate the ability of NWSG to provide adequate summer performance for cattle grazing in the mid-south.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>DRD2 and XKR4: A genetic approach to fescue toxicosis.</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ely, Kristine Marie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum Schreb) is the most prevalent forage in the Mid-south United States due to its observed hearty nature and ability to withstand heavy grazing. This is due to a symbiotic relationship with an endophytic fungus (Neotyphodium coenophialum). This fungus produces ergot alkaloids, which can bind to many adrenergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic receptors. One of the primary functions of dopamine is to inhibit prolactin response. Decreased growth, reproduction, lactation, and depressed serum prolactin concentrations are commonly observed in beef cattle grazing endophyte-infected tall fescue. These symptoms are collectively referred to as fescue toxicosis, and are estimated to cause over $600 million in losses to the beef industry annually. Polymorphisms in the Dopamine Receptor D2 (DRD2) and XK, Kell blood group complex subunit related family member 4 (XKR4) genes may modulate these responses. The objective of this study was to assess associations between each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and serum prolactin concentration, hair coat score (HCS), body condition score (BCS), adjusted birth weight (ABW) and adjusted 205-day weight (A205) in fall calving beef cattle grazing endophyte infected tall fescue in Missouri. The results indicated that dam genotype for DRD2 and XKR4 combined were associated with serum prolactin concentrations (p = 0.04). Serum prolactin concentrations were greater in cows having 2 copies of the ‘A’ allele for DRD2 and at least 1 ‘A’ allele for XKR4. Dam genotype for DRD2 was associated with HCS and BCS (p = 0.0024 and p = 0.011, respectively). The association between dam genotype for DRD2 and hair coat score was similar to what has been seen previously. Dam genotype for DRD2 and XKR4 differed in ABW (p &lt; 0.0001 and p = 0.027, respectively), such that dams with the ‘AG’ genotype for DRD2 and ‘GG’ genotype for XKR4 had increased ABW. Calf genotype for XKR4 was associated with A205 (p = 0.011); calves with the ‘AA’ genotype had increased A205 compared to calves with the ‘AG’ or ‘GG’ genotype. These results suggest that the use of these genetic markers could improve cow-calf production in beef cattle grazing endophyte-infected tall fescue.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Impact of Heat Stress on Germinal Vesicle Breakdown and Lipolytic Changes during In Vitro Maturation of Bovine Oocytes</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hooper, Leah Marie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The main objective of this research was to examine the lipolytic changes in triglyceride and phospholipid as well as the incidence of germinal vesicle breakdown during IVM of heat-stressed oocytes compared to non-stressed oocytes. To this end, cumulus-oocyte complexes were matured for 0, 2, 4, 6 or 24 hIVM at 38.5 or 41.0°C (first 12 h only, then transferred to 38.5°C). Triglyceride and phospholipid levels decreased by 2 hIVM (P = 0.0009 and P = 0.0005, respectively) but remained fairly constant to 24 hIVM; lipid decline was not affected by maturation temperature. Elevated maturation temperature hastened meiotic progression by 4 hIVM (P &lt; 0.0001). Incidence of germinal vesicle breakdown was associated, though not directly related, to lipolytic changes in oocyte triglyceride and phospholipid content (R2 [R-squared] = 0.2123 and P = 0.0030; R2 = 0.2243 and P = 0.0026, respectively). Oocyte ATP content was measured as an indirect indicator of lipolysis (i.e., mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation [beta-oxidation] of fatty acids freed during lipolysis of triglyceride/phospholipid for ATP production). The ATP content of oocytes increased during IVM and was greater in heat-stressed oocytes at 24 hIVM compared to controls (P = 0.0082). Levels of ATP were associated, though not directly related, to changes in oocyte triglyceride and phospholipid content (R2 = 0.1086 and P = 0.0184; R2 = 0.1252 and P = 0.0096, respectively). In summary, heat stress-induced hastening of oocyte germinal vesicle breakdown was not directly explained by lipolytic changes in triglycerides and phospholipids nor the oocyte ATP content.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Relationships of temperament, endocrine, reproductive, and behavioral parameters measured during performance testing of bulls</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lockwood, Sierra Ashley</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The aim of this study was to examine relationships between bull temperament, behavior, growth, endocrine, and reproductive parameters measured over an 84 d test period. Bulls (n = 65) were reared in 6 pens separated on BW and age. Pen scores were assigned on d -1, 27, 55 and 83. On d 0, 28, 56, and 84, exit velocity, BW, time it took each bull to leave the chute, bull order through chute, and hair and blood samples were recorded or collected. Frame score was calculated, carcass ultrasounds and breeding soundness exams were performed on d 84. ADG was calculated for each period (period 1 = d 0-28; period 2 = d 29-56; period 3 = d 57-84) and over the 84 d. Bulls (n=30; 3 pens) received dataloggers to measure activity during period 1 and 3. Bulls were categorized into three temperament (pen score + exit velocity / 2) categories (docile, intermediate, and temperamental).
Temperamental bulls tended (P=0.07) to enter the chute system prior to docile bulls on d 84 and weighed less (P&lt;0.05) than docile bulls on d 0, 28, and 56. Frame score was less (P&lt;0.05) for temperamental bulls than docile bulls on d 84 (5.88 ± 0.13 vs. 6.34 ± 0.18). Bulls categorized as intermediate on d 56 had greater (P&lt;0.05; 2.10 ± 0.04 kg/d) overall ADG than docile (1.94 ± 0.06 kg/d) and temperamental bulls (1.92 ± 0.06 kg/d).
Docile bulls had greater serum (P=0.06) and hair testosterone (P&lt;0.05) and lower (P&lt;0.05) serum cortisol concentration than temperamental bulls on d 56. Docile and intermediate bulls tended (P=0.07) to have a lower percentage of primary spermatic defects (20.58 ± 4.86 %) than temperamental bulls (38.01 ± 8.06 %) on d 84. Serum testosterone measured on d 28 and 56 was positively correlated to BW (r = 0.47 and 0.39; P&lt;0.01). On d 28, BW was positively correlated (r = 0.32; P&lt;0.05) to hair testosterone and negatively correlated to hair cortisol (r = -0.31; P&lt;0.05).
In conclusion, selecting bulls based on docility could increase BW, frame score, serum and hair testosterone concentration, and lower serum cortisol concentrations.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Characterization of the Reproductive Tract in Recipients for Bovine Embryo Transfer: pH and Bacterial Presence</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Roper, David Allen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Pregnancy rates of bovine recipients following embryo transfer are key factors in profitability and genetic gains. The uterus is a dynamic organ that is essential for pregnancy; however, no selection criterion for recipient uterine environment exists. At transfer, pH and temperature of the ipsilateral uterine horn at site of embryo deposit and vagina were recorded in experiment one (n = 120). Vaginal pH and ipsilateral horn pH were correlated (r=0.72, P &lt;0.0001). Vaginal and ipsilateral pH and temperature did not differ between pregnant and non-pregnant animals in experiment one. Measuring uterine environment decreased pregnancy rates (27 versus 55%, P = 0.03; pregnant versus non-pregnant, respectively). In experiment two, abattoir collected reproductive tracts (n = 43) revealed a correlation between ipsilateral uterine horn and vagina pH (r = 0.59, P &lt; 0.0001) and temperature (r = 0.81, P &lt; 0.0001) utilizing the field probe. Logistic regression models in experiment three recipient animals (n = 136, vaginal pH and temperature with field probe) predicted pregnancy likelihood based on vaginal pH (P = 0.15), vaginal temperature (P = 0.3), and rectal temperature (P = 0.15). Groups based on these models revealed no impact of vaginal pH (P = 0.42) or rectal temperature groups on pregnancy rates (P = 0.83 and 0.59, respectively). Chapter 3 utilized abattoir bovine reproductive tracts (n = 43) with an approximate day 7 corpus luteum for analysis of bacteria presence on uterine and vaginal pH. Anaerobic presence impacted pH in ANOVA and regression models (P = 0.05 and P = 0.02, respectively). Bacterial presence in the ipsilateral horn did not affect ipsilateral pH, and vaginal bacterial growth did not predict ipsilateral horn environment. Thus, vaginal pH was highly correlated to ipsilateral horn pH. Presence of bacteria at site of embryo deposit did not impact ipsilateral horn pH.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Effect of Cow Weight , Fat Thickness and Body Measurements on the Subsequent Performance of Her Calf</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Murphey, James Farley, III</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The production of the maximum pounds of beef at weaning is a subject of utmost importance to Tennessee cattlemen. They have been striving to achieve this goal mainly through increased cow size. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to determine the relationship between cow size as measured by weight, fat and body dimension and the performance of her calf.
Over a five-year period, records were obtained on 411 Angus and 328 Hereford cows and their calves. In Analysis I, included data were taken in 1967 through 1970 on each cow and her calf. These data were used to determine the relationship between cow weight corrected to a fat constant basis and calf performance. These data included weight and fat thickness of each cow taken in the fall of the year and weight and fat thickness for each calf at weaning and at one year of age. Analysis II included data taken in 1969 through 1971. A weight and fat thickness was obtained for each cow and calf in the same manner as in Analysis I, and four body measurements (depth, length, wither height and hook height) were taken on each cow and her calf at weaning. In this analysis year, weaning age, cow age, cow weight and cow fat were held constant in order to determine the relationship between cow size (body measurements) and calf size and performance.
In Analysis I, cow weight was found to have a positive, non-significant effect on weaning weight per 100 lb. increase in cow weight ranged from 7.3 to 12.2 lb. while the increase in cow weight ranged from 2.6 to 25.2 lb.  Cow fat was found to significantly affect the weaning weight of bull calves but not the weaning weight of heifers. This relationship between cow fat and weaning weight was negative. A similar trend was found in the relationship between cow fat and yearling weight.
In Analysis II, cow body measurements were, generally, found to have no significant effect on weaning weight. Cow body length and body depth had no significant effect on weaning body length or depth. Cow wither height had a significant effect on the weaning wither height of heifers, and cow hook height had a significant effect on the weaning hook height of bulls.
In this study 57.4, 84.6, 74.9 and 73.1 percent of the variation in weaning weight was explained by variation in cow weight and fatness in Hereford bulls, Angus bulls, Hereford heifers and Angus heifers, respectively. When the three linear cow measurements (length of body, depth of body and height) were added to the model, the coefficients of determination increased by 0.029, 0.033, 5.1 and 0.08 for the four breed-sex groups, respectively.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Winter Pasture Investigations with Beef Calves</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Moorman, Robert, Jr.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In Tennessee the value of winter pasture in the wintering ration for producing slaughter and stocker cattle was unknown. No information was available on the type carcasses that could be produced by a ration involving winter pasture. Other problems which needed investigation were ; cost of producing winter pasture, soil types best suited for winter pasture, size and kind of animals to use, rate of grazing and the effects of varying amounts of moisture and temperature.
Because of the state's wide soil and climatic variation, winter pasture projects were started at four locations of University of Tennessee Agricultural Experiment Stations;  namely, Tobacco Experiment Station, Greeneville, Main Experiment Station, Knoxville, Middle Tennessee Experiment Station, Columbia and West Tennessee Experiment Station, Jackson.  Projects were started at these stations in the fall of 1949 with the following objectives:
1.  To study the use of winter pasture for wintering and finishing calves.
2.  To compare the effect of different rations, when fed with winter pasture, to produce slaughter and stocker cattle.
3.  To study the reception at Tennessee markets of yearlings carried to a good to choice finish largely on pasture and roughage.
4.  To evaluate the market reception and qualities of carcasses from calves fed on silage, hay and concentrates.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Supplementation of Degossypolized Cottonseed Meal in Rations for Growing and Fattening Swine</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Piercy, Richard Travis</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Introduction: Cotton is one of the major sources of income in southern agriculture. Cotton is the highest income crop in Tennessee and is a leading crop in several other southern states. Because of large scale production of cotton in the South, cottonseed meal, a by-product of the industry, has usually been the cheapest and most plentiful of the protein supplements available for livestock feeding in this area.
In the past the use of cottonseed meal in livestock rations has been limited mainly to the feeding of ruminants. Swine and poultry show the effects of gossypol toxicity when fed large quantities of ground cottonseed or most of the commercially available cottonseed meals.
Recently, improved meals, produced at lower temperatures and with a very low free gossypol content, have been made available. Boatner et al. (1948), Milligand and Bird (1951), Altschul et al. (1954) and others have shown that these new type cottonseed meals can be fed to chicks at relatively high levels with no visible harmful effects. Unpublished data from the University of Tennessee Nutritional Experimental laboratory (obtained in conducting feeding trials for Animal Husbandry 532) indicate that similar results have been obtained with very young albino rats. The quantities which may be used in swine rations have been re-evaluated during the past few years. For example, Stephenson (1952) of Arkansas has demonstrated that cottonseed meal can be used in a swine ration to make up all or a large portion of the protein supplement. Cottonseed meal has been used successfully in complete pre-mixed rations for swine where its exact percentage in the ration can be controlled.
In view of the fact that most of the work using these new meals is swine rations was with pre-mixed rations containing cottonseed meal at a fixed level, it was decided to determine the extent to which one of the new meals could be used as part or all of a self-fed supplement to be fed with shelled corn to growing-fattening swine on pasture. Rate of gain, feed consumption, and palatability were problems concerning which additional information was needed to determine whether these meals could be recommended for self-feeding in swine rations.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Placental Transfer and Maternal-Fetal Utilization of Manganese by Third Trimester Pregnant Heifers</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wanamaker, Boyce P.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Although manganese has been demonstrated to be required for normal life processes, little information is available on the placental transfer and maternal-fetal utilization of this mineral in the bovine. Nine pregnant and three non-pregnant heifers were used in this study. They were dosed with a tracer level of radio-manganese for blood balance and subsequent placental transfer and maternal-fetal manganese utilization studies. Results of this study suggested total blood radio-manganese levels to drop from 14% of the administered dose at 3 hours to 1.8% after 144 hours. Blood clearance studies indicated that equilibrium between red cells and plasma was reached 38 hours post-dosing, and further data suggested that approximately 50% of the plasma manganese was protein bound. Eighteen percent of an intravenous 54Mn dose was excreted by pregnant heifers 144 hours after dosing. Bile appeared to be a major excretory pathway for manganese, and urine a minor excretory pathway. Liver served as the main metabolic pool for manganese in both the dam and fetus. Data suggested that heifers retained a calculated 1.16 mg manganese per day and deposited 82 ug (7.0% of that retained) in the total products of conception. Third-trimester bovine fetuses (272 days) contained 19.1 mg stable manganese; placenta, 2.10 mg and placental fluids 1.20 mg, for a total of 22.4 mg manganese in the total products of conception. Pregnant heifers deposited in the total products of conception a calculated 82 ug manganese per day, suggesting that 82 ug manganese per day was needed to support the products of conception in the pregnant heifer.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effects of Initial Subcutaneous Fat, Grade, and Weight of Feeder Heifers on Their Subsequent Feedlot Performance and Carcass Characteristics</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Rowland, David M.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>One hundred-eighty feeder heifers (150 Hereford, 29 Angus and one crossbred) of Choice, Good and Medium feeder grades were fed to determine the effects of initial subcutaneous fat thickness, feeder grade and initial weight on their feedlot performances and carcass quality and cutability. Heifers were purchased at graded feeder calf sales in East Tennessee.
After an adjustment period of three weeks, the heifers were fed corn silage ad libitum, treated at the time of ensiling with 10 pounds each of urea and ground limestone plus six pounds of concentrate per head per day, for 110 days, and then full-fed a concentrate ration of eight parts ground shelled corn to one part 41 percent cottonseed meal, to finish the heifers at an ultrasonically estimated fat thickness of 10 mm. or 8 mm.
Initial weight was found to have a small, but significant (P &lt; .001) effect on final weight, carcass weight, yield grade and estimated percent retail yield.
Feeder grade had a highly significant (P &lt; .01) effect on dressing percent, and a very highly significant (P &lt; .001) effect on carcass conformation grade. Variation in feeder grade did not significantly influence the other measures of performance or carcass characteristics. Simple correlations of feeder grade with roughage phase average daily gain, overall average daily gain, yield grade and percent retail yield were -0.06, -0.04, 0.14 and -0.17, respectively.
An additional 4.41 percent of the variation in overall average daily gain was explained by variation in initial subcutaneous fat when initial weight and grade were held constant. Initial fat also accounted for an additional 5.29 percent of the variation in carcass fat, 2.35 percent of the variation in yield grade, and 1.74 percent of the variation in retail yield. These percentages were small and non-significant (P &gt; ,05) in all cases. In comparison, fitting initial condition grade to the original model accounted for an additional 11.97 percent of the variation in overall average daily gain, 10.36 percent of the variation in carcass fat, 4.70 percent of the variation in yield grade, and 3.85 percent of the variation in estimated retail yield. The gross simple correlation between initial fat and initial condition grade was 0.57. The correlation between feeder grade and type grade was 0.88. Correlations were obtained for feeder grade with initial fat and initial condition grade of 0.41 and 0.76, respectively, and for type grade with initial fat and initial condition were 0.09 and 0.14, respectively, indicating initial fat and initial condition are inseparable parts of feeder grade.
Heifers that were slaughtered when the ultrasonically estimated fat thickness reached 8 mm. produced carcasses comparable to those of heifers slaughtered at 10 mm. fat thickness. There were no significant (P &gt; .05) differences between the two fat levels in carcass grade, yield grade and percent retail yield. The heifers fed to 8 mm. subcutaneous fat finished 10 days earlier than the 10 mm. level heifers, and cost per hundredweight gain overall was in favor of the 8 mm. level heifers by $0,85.
Results of this experiment indicate that either of the three grades may be fed with equal success, and that price spreads between feeder grades of equal weight may be the most important consideration in purchasing feeder heifers.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Use of Varying Levels of Urea in Concentrates Fed to Dairy Cattle</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Plummer, John Roland</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Five experiments were conducted to investigate the use of concentrates that contained varying levels of urea for dairy cattle fed corn silage as the only forage.
Three experiments were conducted using 84 Holstein cows. Twenty-seven cows were used in Experiment I to compare a concentrate supplemented with soybean meal with a concentrate in which 2 percent urea (by weight) replaced a portion of the soybean meal on an equal nitrogen basis. Effects of frequency of feeding of concentrates containing urea were also studied. Results indicated that ration intake, body weight changes, milk production, milk protein, and milk SNF were not significantly different (P&gt;0.05) for cows fed corn silage plus a concentrate containing either 0 or 2 percent urea. No significant differences were observed between treatments when a concentrate containing 2 percent urea was fed six times a day versus twice a day.
Thirty cows were used in Experiment II to compare a concentrate that contained soybean meal with a concentrate that contained 3 percent urea. Effect of the addition of sodium sulfate to a concentrate that contained 3 percent urea was also studied. Results indicated that silage intake, total dry matter intake, milk production, milk protein, and milk SNF were not significantly different (P&gt;0.05) in cows fed corn silage plus a concentrate that contained either 0 or 3 percent urea. Milk fat percent was significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) in cows that were fed the concentrate that contained 3 percent urea. The data indicated that a ration of corn silage (0.17 percent sulfur on a dry matter basis) plus a concentrate that contained 3 percent urea (concentrate contained 0.15 percent sulfur on a dry matter basis) did not appear to be deficient in sulfur.
Twenty-seven cows were used in experiment III to study the utilization of concentrates containing 3 percent urea with and without phosphate supplements. Results indicated that the addition of dicalcium phosphate and monosodium phosphate did not appear to improve the ration utilization of concentrates containing 3 percent urea. However, it should be pointed out that the phosphate source may be needed for purposes other than for the utilization of urea.
Two experiments using 32 Holstein heifers were conducted to study the effects of concentrates containing urea on nitrogen balances and palatability. In Experiment IV, nitrogen balances were conducted on 16 heifers fed concentrates which contained no protein supplement, soybean meal, 1.3 percent urea plus monosodium phosphate, or 1.3 percent urea without the monosodium phosphate supplement. Results indicated that nitrogen retention was directly related to nitrogen intake and digestibility. The addition of the monosodium phosphate to the concentrate containing urea did not significantly affect nitrogen balances. In Experiment V, 16 heifers were used in a palatability study of concentrates containing urea with and without phosphate supplements. A palatability study was also conducted comparing concentrates which contained either 0 or 3 percent urea. Results indicated that animals adapted to a concentrate which contained no phosphate supplements preferred concentrates which contained no dicalcium phosphate over concentrates which contained dicalcium phosphate, or dicalcium phosphate plus monosodium phosphate. If the animals were adapted to a concentrate that contained urea plus dicalcium phosphate and monosodium phosphate, the animals preferred the concentrate that contained both phosphate supplements over concentrates that contained only one of the phosphate supplements. Results indicated that the animals preferred the concentrates that contained no urea as compared to concentrates that contained 3 percent urea. However, it should be noted that animals offered concentrates that contained 3 percent urea did consume these concentrates, but at a reduced rate.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Influence of Initial Cow Weight on Progeny Performance and TDN Efficiency in Production of Slaughter Cattle</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Neel, James Burkett</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Data utilized in this study were from records (collected over a two-year period) of 45 Angus cow-calf pairs in which both the individual TDN consumption of the cows over a twelve month period and the individual TDN consumption of the calves from birth to slaughter (excluding TDN provided by milk) were recorded. The objectives of this study were to determine total digestible nutrient (TDN) consumed by cows of various sizes and weights, to determine the TDN intake of both cow and calf per unit weight of slaughter calves which varied in growth potential, to establish weights at which maximum TDN utilization occurred, and to establish relationships among characteristics of cows and calves, and overall TDN efficiencies for various periods.
Cows were selected at weaning, confined to individual pens and individually fed to the following weaning. Cows selected ranged in weight from 835 lb. to 1,195 lb.   In addition to initial weight, skeletal measurements and subcutaneous fat deposition between the twelfth and thirteenth ribs were recorded at the initiation of each trial. Milk production of the cows were made at 28-day intervals.
(Abbreviated)
These results indicated that TDN efficiency at weaning was primarily a function of size of both the dam and progeny while at point of maximum TDN utilization, size of the dam and progeny exhibited very little influence on TDN efficiency.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Variations in the Gross Anatomy of the Heart of Rana pipiens</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wilson, Leslie Wingate</dc:creator>
<dc:description>There were three purposes for this study. The first purpose was to determine the normal anatomy of the major structure of the heart of Rana pipiens. The second purpose was to determine if any variations or anomalies existed in these structures. The third purpose was to determine if any similarity existed between any variations found and the hearts of other animals.
The normal anatomy of the frog heart, as described in most books, is either incomplete, wrong, or applies to species other than Rana pipiens. In no case was there an adequate description found of the heart as possessed by Rana pipiens. For this reason, a study of the anatomy of the heart of Rana pipiens is important.
In the evolution of the frog, there are so many factors involved that none of the frogs has a definite or set anatomy. On the contrary, some measure of variation occurs in every animal. This study dealt only with the gross variations in the major structures of the heart and did not include a microscopic examination or an examination of the minor structures, such as the valves.
The importance of similarities of structures of different species of animals in the study of evolution is very great. To show that a variation of a structure has a similarity to the corresponding structure in another species may indicate a genetic relationship between the two. Variations may show the trends of evolution or may show regressions to more primitive conditions. Sometimes, however, they are simply abnormalities in the development of the individual animal.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Life History and Ecology of the Barrens Topminnow, &lt;em&gt;Fundulus julisia&lt;/em&gt; Williams and Etnier (Pisces, Fundulidae)</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Rakes, Patrick L.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The life history of the Barrens topminnow, Fundulus julisia, was investigated in a two-year study from 1983 to 1985. The species is restricted to a few isolated springs and groundwater-influenced upland streams on the Barrens Plateau in the vicinity of Manchester in middle Tennessee. In most aspects of its behavior, including feeding and reproduction, this topminnow differs little from other members of the same genus. The fish is an opportunistic carnivore, feeding upon aquatic insects, crustaceans, and gastropods, as well as terrestrial insects that fall in water. Like other killifish, F. julisia has an extended breeding season that is bimodal with peaks in the last spring and late summer. The requirement of filamentous algae and/or other aquatic plants for a spawning site and the paucity of permanent upland waters supporting their growth is apparently the primary factor limiting the species to its currently restricted distribution. F. julisia has a maximum lifespan of about three years, but mortality is high among adults following reproduction and relatively few survive to spawn more than once. Mortality is higher in males than in females older than one year, presumably due to selective predation upon the more brightly colored males. Growth in the first year is very rapid when compared to other Fundulus. Possible predators of young Barrens topminnows are numerous, but piscivorous wading birds are probably the primary predators of adults. A potentially serious threat to all Barrens topminnow populations is Gambusia affinis which bears live young continuously throughout the warmer months and tends to grossly outnumber topminnows where the two are syntopic. The mosquitofish has been known to replace native species elsewhere. Droughts of the past few years as well as habitat alterations by man, especially those affecting groundwater levels, also may endanger the species' survival.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Site of Absorption of Xanthophylls and Factors Affecting Pigmentation of Chickens, Egg Yolks, and Products Made From Egg Yolks</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Littlefield, Lloyd Henry</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A total of four experiments were conducted to determine the location of the site of absorption of xanthophylls, to determine the relationship of egg yolk color produced by various feed xanthophylls to the color of mayonnaise, and to study the effect of the level of dietary cow manure, age, ambient temperature and feed consumption of xanthophyll pigmentation of hens and egg yolks.
Increases in the level of blood xanthophylls and visual pigmentation of xanthophyll depleted hens were used to measure the absorption of xanthophylls. Surgical removal of either the duodenum, jejunum, ileum or large intestine resulted in a slight but significant decrease in absorption of xanthophyll when compared to the sham operated chicks and ligation of the ceca resulted in a slight increase. Only the removal of that section of the jejunum-ileum affected by E. maxima resulted in the chicks with no significant absorption when compared to chicks fed a diet free of xanthophylls. It is concluded that most absorption of xanthophylls in the chick takes place in this middle section of the jejunum-ileum.
Mayonnaise was made with yolks from hens fed diets containing no xanthophyll, 23 milligrams of xanthophyll per kilogram and the latter diet plus 66 milligrams of xanthophyll per kilogram from yellow, orange or red concentrate. The egg yolks appeared different, but no significant differences were found between the yolks from hens fed the diets with the added concentrates.
As measured by a triangle test, mayonnaise made from the egg yolks from hens fed the xanthophyll free diet had the lightest color. Mayonnaise made from egg yolks from hens fed the &quot;layer&quot; plus yellow concentrate and &quot;layer&quot; plus orange concentrate were not significantly different.
The red concentrate had the greatest carry-over effect. The color of mayonnaise depends on the kind and amount of xanthophylls present.
Dried cow manure was added at the rate of 0, 2.5, 5, or 10 kilograms per 100 kilograms of diets containing 0 and 23 milligrams of xanthophylls per kilogram to determine the effect on pigmentation. There was a high positive linear correlation between the amount of cow manure added and the amount of xanthophyll in the blood. There was a high negative linear correlation between pigmenting efficiency and the amount of manure added to the diet. Cow manure was a good source of xanthophylls, but its xanthophylls were not efficiently utilized.
The effect of age, temperature and amount of feed consumed on yolk pigmentation was studied. Both young and old hens were housed in rooms designed to simulate winter and summer temperatures. Half of the hens of each age group at each temperature had access to feed ad libitum and the other half received feed limited to 90 percent of that consumed in the hot rooms by hens on the ad libitum regime.
The hens in the &quot;cool&quot; rooms produced egg yolks with the greatest pigmentation. A four month difference in age was not a major factor in causing light colored yolks. However, egg yolk color generally became lighter as the hens grew older. In one trial limited feeding resulted in deeper pigmented yolks as measured by yolk xanthophyll levels. It is concluded that the reduction of the yolk xanthophyll levels during summer is associated more with high temperature per se, and less with aging and a drop in feed consumption as generally assumed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Repeatable, Visual Survey of Three Rare &lt;em&gt;Percina&lt;/em&gt; (Osteichthyes: Percidae) Fish in Little River, Blount County, Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Heacock, Charles H.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A recent apparent decline of the darter species in Little River, Blount County, Tennessee, suggested a deterioration on habitat quality was taking place. The objective of this study was to establish a baseline of the abundance and distribution of three large and easily recognized darter species (Percina aurantiaca, P. burtoni, and P. macrocephala) believed to be very pollution intolerant.
The study area included 27 river miles with 20 accessible sites which were determined by an area reconnaissance. Each site has been described, including diagrams and photographs, and was surveyed six times between July and October 1993. A review of published accounts of the darters' habitats are presented along with observations of the unique type of stream habitat utilized by each darter.
This visual study was set up to be repeatable, using site and habitat descriptions, for future monitoring of the fish populations. The baseline of abundance included adults and young-of-the-year of the three species. The number of fish sightings was compiled from the 120 observations conducted during the 6 surveys at each site. Additional information included sightings of fish observed in areas adjacent to the survey sites. Finally, a comparison was made between the 1993 study and a survey following a historical flood in 1994.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Responses of Ecologically Dissimilar Populations of the Water Snake, &lt;em&gt;Natrix sipedon sipedon&lt;/em&gt; to Surface Extracts of Prey Species, With Observations on Feeding and Defense Behaviors</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Gove, Doris</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Observations of defensive and feeding behavior of Natrix sipedon were made in the field and in the lab. Crypticity, mimicry of poisonous snakes, striking, production of cloacal secretion and tail autonomy were defensive behaviors discussed. Feeding behaviors discussed were hunting, catching prey and tongue-flicking.
Experiments were performed on the responses of snakes from ecologically dissimilar populations of N. sipedon to surface extracts of local prey species. The populations were: (1) a laboratory-reared litter of ten one-year-old snakes; (2) six wild-caught snakes from Sterchi's fish hatchery in north Knoxville, Tennessee; and (3) six wild-caught and eight newborn snakes (a litter) from the Tremont area of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Extracts were made of prey species caught in both areas or obtained in the laboratory. Response scores were combined measure of tongue-flicks and attack latency.
Group one snakes responded significantly more to goldfish (C. auratus), than to any other extract. This species has been their food for one year. Group 2 also responded more the C. auratus than to any other fish extract. The goldfish was abundant at Sterchi's. However, Group 3 responded significantly more to extracts of fish that were caught near Tremont than to C. auratus. That snakes discriminated between different genera of prey was shown. The conclusion was made that wild-caught snakes respond more often to extracts of sympatric prey, presumably because these snakes have had experience eating this prey. Young of the Tremont snakes responded more to extracts of sympatric prey than to C. auratus, but the difference was not significant. This technique can be used, in conjunction with other investigations, to assess ecological relationship in an area.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Amphibians and Reptiles of Chilhowee Mountain</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wilder, Cleo Duke, Jr.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Introduction: In the past some reptiles and amphibians have been reported from the general area of Chilhowee Mountain (i.e., within the counties through which the mountain extends). However, no one has ever made an exhaustive study of these two groups of vertebrates on the mountain itself. The neighboring Great Smoky Mountains National Park offers one of the most interesting and extensively studied areas of the Southeast. The purpose of the present study has been to gather enough evidence for a comparison of the reptiles and amphibians of Chilhowee Mountain (more specifically, a representative part of the mountain most easily reached from the University of Tennessee) with those of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The most useful reference for this comparison has been Willis King's survey of the herpetology of the Park (1939). In addition to the occurrence of particular species, the possibility of altitudinal limits in distribution was kept in mind during the study. Finally, it was desirable to compare the abundance of the two classes of vertebrates of the two areas in relation to the habitats available.</dc:description>
